The cryptocurrency space has two opinionated and well defined groups—believers and nonbelievers.
To date, there has been little middle ground.
However, this is quickly changing.
Indeed, financial services firms are seeing increasing demand from their customers for access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency-related products, and the capital markets also are confronting a broad set of crypto-related developments.
As the space continues to develop, other organizations are exploring whether to get involved, and where to begin.
Given the dynamic nature of the market, the emerging legal and regulatory climate, and the sheer volatility of crypto assets, it can be a daunting task to define the space or even understand the strategic rationale of introducing a cryptocurrency into an organization.
This is especially true for directors and executives who may not be well versed in cryptocurrencies, their limitations, or even the underlying technology—not to mention the regulatory, risk, accounting, data security, and tax considerations that arise when dealing with a new asset class or service offering.
This is a seemingly simple question, but since most people answer about what they think, hope, or want cryptocurrencies to be, it is a confusing one.
Cryptocurrencies are a digital asset that started as a medium of exchange for people to buy goods and services.
Over time, their functionality has expanded.
Cryptocurrency value can be pegged to underlying asset such as U.S.
dollar, central bank digital currencies, privacy coins (senders and receivers are anonymous), governance tokens (gives owners the right to vote in decisions regarding blockchain’s future development), utility tokens, and non-fungible tokens (distinct characteristics from all others).
This is from a developer/development side.
Of course, there are also investors and speculators who are hoping for appreciation.
It is very important you know the intent and functionality of cryptocurrency you own or are considering owning.
Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a shared, digital ledger called a blockchain.
This is decentralized technology, spread across many computers, that records every transaction.
Blockchain is the technology that allows for cryptocurrencies to work.
It is a decentralized and digital ledger of transactions used for cryptocurrencies and other assets/functions.
It is important to separate the technology behind cryptocurrencies from the actual cryptocurrencies.
The most popular and widely heard of cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.
As of early January 2021, the total cryptocurrency market is over $1 trillion, and Bitcoin is around $700 billion.
Believe it or not, there are over 7,800 cryptocurrencies in existence and growing.
The top five, with over 80 percent of the market value, are Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, and Litecoin.
(footnote 2) People saw the success of Bitcoin and tried to improve existing functionality and provide new functionality with new cryptocurrencies.
Additionally, investors and developers were certainly trying to make money.
Since cryptocurrency operates on a decentralized network that lacks a central authority, it is possible to exchange cryptocurrency without registering an identity.
Yes, since the start there have been criminal activities with cryptocurrencies.
However, the blockchain publicly records every transaction, and while names are not assigned to addresses, you can trace activity back to a crypto exchange, which knows the end user.
The estimates vary for how many transactions are for illegal activities and proponents of cryptocurrency point to illegal activity with traditional currencies.
(Source: NY Times article Jan 2020) Yes.
In 2013, the U.S.
Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) stated that it is legal to invest in Bitcoin and use it as a form of payment as long as the seller is willing to accept it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has designated cryptocurrency as digital currency, the Commodity Future Trading Commission as commodities, and the IRS as property.
You can purchase in any state, but certain states have imposed regulations.
As an example, New York has a policy where any business must apply for a BitLicense if it is dealing with cryptocurrency.
As adoption increases, look for regulatory and legal updates at the federal and state level.
There are a couple of methods, but the simplest and least expensive is via an online cryptocurrency exchange.
You establish an account and from there, you transfer in cash and purchase the cryptocurrency of your choice.
The exchange will allow you to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency.
The user experience, fees, and identification requirements all vary based on the exchange, so it is important to conduct research before you do anything.
Some of the most popular are Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken.
Additionally, traditional online brokers are starting to offer services such as eToro and Robinhood.
Further, fintech and technology companies are starting to offer these services (Square and PayPal as two examples).
Simply put, crypto wallets are places to store digital assets more securely than just on an exchange.
 You hold your wallet via an exchange account, custody wallet, or outside of the exchange.
You can establish an online or “hot” wallet that is internet connected—to your desktop, table or mobile phone.
There is also the option to store on a device that is not connected to the internet (“cold” wallet).
Cold wallets are the most secure way to store your cryptocurrency, but they are meant for longer-term holdings as they are not connected to the internet.
With cold storage, you must remember your private keys (identifier number for your cryptocurrency).
Believe it or not, there are Bitcoin ATMs.
You insert cash and bitcoins are transferred to your secure, digital wallet.
There are also peer-to-peer (PTP) exchanges.
Users post what they are hoping to buy or sell and then choose their trading partner(s).
These products are just starting to come to the marketplace.
The design of these products is to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum without having to directly purchase.
Beyond the fees for doing this, these products currently trade at a very high premium to the underlying cryptocurrency prices.
The premium could continue to persist in the future, but investors need to consider the price they are pricing for the exposure.
Depending on who you ask, you would most likely get a different answer.
Some investors believe it will be a store of value over time and a hedge against traditional fiat money.
Some people just want to speculate and make a quick buck (coin).
Some do want to be part of the ecosystem and use it as an alternative to traditional currency—not as an investment per se but a means of transacting.
In 2014, the IRS issued a notice that virtual and digital currency is treated as property for federal income tax purposes.
When you sell cryptocurrency for capital gain or capital loss, this will be recognized.
Starting in 2019, the IRS specifically asks about cryptocurrency on the first page of Schedule 1.
The expectation is for this to continue going forward and for CPAs to ask this question in their annual tax binder.
Even if the exchange you purchased does not provide tax reporting forms, you need to record your transactions.
Additionally, the IRS does provide a handy FAQ.
America’s gross domestic product plummeted and the zeitgeist changed from a posture of consumerative acquisition to retentive stockpiling.
The stoppage of income led to a stoppage in spending, which in turn brought small businesses to their knees and banks to mounting defaults.
While this book has been extensive in its coverage of disparate areas of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, it still only scratches the surface.
My hope is that the knowledge in this book serves as a solid foundation of this new industry with which you can begin doing substantive research into the areas that draw your attention.
As inflation continues to rise and the dollars we work so hard for become less and less valuable, it’s imperative that you find an appreciating store of value to protect the money you hold.
The most recent inflation numbers in the United States record a value of 7% per year, which means that the dollar in your pocket loses 7% of its already dwindling buying power each year that passes.
It’s bad enough that many of us are entirely dependent on our jobs for financial stability and must trade our finite number of hours for an arbitrary amount of money per hour.
Add a payment that is quickly losing its buying power and that makes for a dire situation indeed.
If you want to play it safe and put your money in an investment vehicle that can’t possibly be devalued, do more research into Bitcoin and decide if it makes sense for you to invest your money into it.
It deserves repeating that you can buy tiny fractions of a bitcoin and don’t need $40,000 on hand to buy a full coin, like you would need when purchasing stocks.
You can start with just $10, and while this will only buy you a tiny fraction of a Bitcoin, it will likely be better than leaving those $10 in your bank account to depreciate by 7% or more per year.
Those with a greater appetite for risk should consider investing in altcoins, NFTs, and micro caps, all of which we discussed at length in earlier chapters.
While these are risky investments and could very well send your money to zero, if you know what you’re doing you have a good chance of making returns that are unheard of in the stock market.
Cryptocurrency presents so many opportunities to make a life-changing amount of money.
In all my years of investing I’ve never seen asset classes that have so easily made those with the right combination of luck and timing millionaires.
Indeed, it’s almost frustrating to look back six months at different projects that have had meteoric rises and calculate how much you could have made had you invested before the pump.
There are hundreds of these same scenarios, where many have been invested at the right time and have made millions.
The good news, however, is that there will be hundreds more of these scenarios.
How do you find out about them? Get involved and do your research.
Follow the blockchain and cryptocurrency experts I listed in Chapter 6.
Read articles, listen to podcasts, and watch YouTube videos.
There has never been an easier time in history to learn from industry experts and better your understanding of complex areas.
Rise up and take responsibility for your financial future.
The hard work you do now can pay off in years or even months when you have more money than you know what to do with.
Although the cryptocurrency environment as a whole is still fraught with risk, it’s safe to say that it’s not going anywhere.
It’s currently a $2 trillion dollar industry, even after a 30% loss across the board, and it will get bigger.
An industry that big doesn’t simply disappear.
Crypto is here to stay and those with long-term investing goals will do well to accumulate now and hold for years, even decades.
Do your due diligence and free your money from the corrosive effects of inflation and who knows, you might even acquire financial independence along the way.
Best of luck, my friends.
The onset of the Coronavirus Pandemic in early 2020 catalyzed a chain reaction of events that have dramatically changed the financial landscape.
Millions of Americans and employees worldwide found themselves unable to work as businesses shuttered to combat the spread of the novel virus.
America’s gross domestic product plummeted and the zeitgeist changed from a posture of consumerative acquisition to retentive stockpiling.
The stoppage of income led to a stoppage in spending, which in turn brought small businesses to their knees and banks to mounting defaults.
Faced with this rising crisis, the American government turned to the Federal Reserve and began issuing stimulus payments to each and every American citizen to buoy the economy.
These payments, of course, did not come from the sale of financial assets or restructuring of the federal budget, but instead out of thin air.
The size and scope of this money printing is hard to comprehend.
In January of 2020, the Federal Reserve held roughly $4 trillion on its balance sheet.
A year later, in January of 2021, this amount had increased to $6.7 trillion through three rounds of stimulus checks and other forms of quantitative easing.
All told, the total amount of dollars ever created increased by 40% in a single year.
In January of 2022, the situation was even worse.
The graph below shows the M1 money supply in the United States, which is composed of currency, demand deposits, and other liquid deposits that can be moved quickly.
Dollars printed by the Federal Reserve are directly represented in the M1 money supply.
As you can see, the M1 money supply has increased to almost $21 trillion in the last year, far above the rate of increase in 2020 and unprecedented in American history.
The result? Roughly 80% of United States dollars in existence today were created in the last two years, at the time of this writing.
Money printing such as this, or any significant increase in a country’s money supply, can lead to a devaluation of the country’s currency.
As the money supply increases, if the rate of production does not also increase, there are more dollars in circulation to buy the same number of goods and services, which causes prices to rise.
Subsequently, a single dollar no longer buys as much as it previously did, and devaluation begins.
In the case of the Coronavirus Pandemic, the amount of dollars in the United States increased dramatically, but the rate of production dropped severely, making this a much more potent recipe for inflation and devaluation than if the rate of production had stayed the same.
Devaluation often goes hand-in-hand with inflation, worsening the effects of higher prices and less potent dollars.
As of November 2021, the United States rate of inflation was calculated to be 6.8% for the twelve month period ending in November 2021.
Compared with previous years, 6.8% is severe, as shown in the chart below: What’s more concerning is that 6.8% may be an artificially low measurement.
The inflation rate is found through calculating the change in the Consumer Price Index over a given period of time.
The Consumer Price Index is a measurement of the average weighted cost of an arbitrary basket of goods at a specific point in time, and the inflation rate is found by measuring the cost for two identical baskets of goods at two different times.
While this is meant to give a general overview of what the inflation rate is across all goods and services, the resulting inflation rate can be artificially set by the choice of goods and services loaded into the arbitrary Consumer Price Index basket.
If the government wants to hide the severity of the inflation rate, they can simply choose items that have inflated little and put those in the basket, resulting in a lower inflation rate than is experienced day to day.
If we take an inflation rate of 6.8% and assume that it stays fixed, which it likely won’t, this means that traditional methods of saving and “storing money in the mattress” are no longer viable.
Money that sits in a bank account during a period of inflation will devalue more and more as inflation rises.
In order to maintain the value of your hard-earned money, you’d have to invest in an asset that guarantees at least 7% interest or appreciation per year, which will never be found through traditional savings accounts, accounts, bonds, or Treasury bills.
This inflationary environment and systematic devaluation of the American dollar spurred the world to look for a store of value that wouldn’t be devalued or manipulated.
Thus began the boom in cryptocurrencies, primarily led by Bitcoin, which many refer to as digital gold.
Cryptocurrencies, and especially Bitcoin, have provided a safe haven for those who are weary of seeing their hard-earned wages consistently eroded.
These digital assets are decentralized, meaning there is no central, governing entity in control of the currency that can manipulate its value or supply.
In fact, in the case of many cryptocurrencies the supply is immutable, which means the currency can never be devalued like has been done to countless fiat currencies.
History has not been kind to countries who engage in excessive money printing.
Perhaps the most famous case of this was seen during the Weimar Republic of Germany, after World War I.
In the wake of the war Germany faced massive debt repayments as the result of deciding to finance the war entirely with debt, rather than with instating an income tax, as France had done.
To make matters worse, the German emperor debased their own currency by taking it off the Gold Standard, which allowed German marks to be exchanged for gold and kept the value of the mark fixed.
The United States government did the same thing during the presidency of Richard Nixon in 1971, which has led to an 80% reduction in the buying power of one dollar in 2022.
The graph below shows how $1 in 1971 now only purchases roughly $0.15 of goods and services: Germany planned to pay back its debt by winning the war and imposing reparations on those it had defeated.
This, of course, didn’t go to plan, starting with Germany losing the war.
To pay back the massive debt of $33 billion dollars, the Weimar Republic began to print money without any economic resources to back it.
The devaluation of the German mark began, and in 1919 it took 48 paper marks to match the purchasing power of one dollar.
As the value of the German mark continued to fall, the Weimar Republic began to buy foreign currencies in order to make reparations payments, but this only exacerbated the devaluation of the mark and rising inflation crisis.
By the end of 1922, the German mark had fallen to 7,400 marks per one American dollar, and the cost of living in the Weimar Republic increased 17 fold.
At the peak of the crisis in late 1923, one US dollar was worth 4,210,500,000,000 German marks.
Images from the Republic during the peak of the crisis show children toting around wheelbarrows full of German marks, burning them, making kites and hats, and building playhouses out of the bricks of devalued currency.
While I like to believe that modern policy makers and fiscal experts have learned lessons from the likes of the Weimar Republic, inflationary periods still hurt the common man, even if it’s not as severe as a period of hyperinflation.
Many of us are already in servitude to our paychecks, trading our finite time for an arbitrary assignment of money per hour.
The problems of a work culture that is still stuck in the Industrial Revolution get exponentially worse when your precious paycheck has less and less buying power, which is why it’s imperative that you find another store of value to combat inflation’s corrosion.
When considering the question of where to invest your money during an inflationary period, many will point you to the stock market.
Index funds are the typical choice if you don’t know what you’re doing, which bundle a broad swath of the stock market into a single investment vehicle.
According to Investopedia, the S&P 500 had an annualized return of 10.5% percent from its inception in 1957 to 2021, and any index fund of the S&P 500 would have had similar returns.
While this is a handsome return and would protect you from mild inflation with room to spare, there are those of us who want more.
Take Bitcoin, for example.
Since 2017, the digital asset has commanded an average of 97% annualized returns, with some years far surpassing that.
CNBC wrote an article detailing how much money an investor would have had they put $1000 in Bitcoin one, five, and ten years ago.
$1,000 in 2016 would have turned into $58,900 in July of 2021, representing a growth of 5,085%.
While these results are not guaranteed across other cryptocurrencies, they’re also not impossible to replicate and surpass.
However, the digital asset market is still a burgeoning environment with inherent volatility and risk.
Although 2021 was a miraculous year for many retail investors in the crypto markets, just as many investors, and likely more, have lost their entire investments by not knowing what they’re doing.
Even the most seasoned investors in digital assets can make mistakes, which is why the general sentiment around investing in cryptocurrencies is, “Only invest what you’re fine with losing.” In other words, only invest an amount of money that wouldn’t ruin your life should you lose all of it.
The volatility and risk of the cryptocurrency markets make this a daunting space to venture into, and with good reason.
That, however, is my reason for writing this book.
There are proven ways to make money through investing in cryptocurrencies, and it’s not as difficult or risky as modern media outlets make it out to be.
The first step in getting comfortable with this space is to become knowledgeable, which is why we’ll spend an entire chapter on the concept of blockchains, as this technology is the backbone of the vast majority of crypto technologies.
If you’re tired of seeing your paycheck’s buying power continually eroded by the slow encroach of inflation, this book is for you.
If you want to learn more about cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and blockchains, this book will guide you through the basics of this rapidly evolving space.
Take control of your money and secure it in appreciating assets that can’t be devalued by excessive money printing and other quantitative easings.
The digital asset industry is still new and those investing in the space now are still early to the party.
The fact that large financial institutions have started investing in cryptocurrencies lends a greater stability to the space as a whole, and gives me confidence that this isn’t just a repeat of the dotcom bubble in the late 90s and early 2000s.
The time to start learning about cryptocurrencies, digital assets, NFTs, blockchain technology, and the metaverse is now.
These will be the investments that future generations wish they could have entered into at the ground floor, but you have the opportunity to learn and secure your financial future today.
Besides a deep dive into blockchain technology, this book also explains the following: Bitcoin, and what makes Bitcoin digital gold Ethereum, and its past and future The top altcoins in the space today, like Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche, and many more NFTs, and how to make your own How to look at a cryptocurrency coin or token and determine if it’s worth investing in Staking, and how to make passive income with cryptocurrency investments Bitcoin mining The Metaverse, and how to invest in our digital future After reading this book, you’ll have the knowledge needed to invest with confidence in digital assets and keep your money safe from rising inflation.
This knowledge will keep you abreast of one of the greatest wealth transfers in all of human history, and skilled investors will have the chance to become financially independent through this nascent space.
Ready to get started? Read on, my friends.
Blockchain.
You hear the word all the time, but still might not know what it means.
Financial pundits and millionaires in their twenties explain that they’re the building blocks of all digital currencies’ infrastructures, but that still doesn’t lend the lightbulb moment of understanding.
And that’s okay! A comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology will be required before we can attempt to grasp other subjects in the field, and that’s why this chapter will be dedicated to the discussion of just that – the blockchain.
What is a Blockchain? A blockchain is a database distributed among nodes on a computer network.
Still gibberish? In English, a blockchain is a storehouse for information that’s distributed across many smaller storehouses.
Those storehouses are actually databases, which are simple software programs for holding and organizing data.
Since a database is digital, a blockchain also stores information in digital format.
Blockchains form the backbone of any cryptocurrency system and their primary function is to maintain a decentralized and secure record of transactions.
One major advantage of a blockchain is that it guarantees the security and fidelity of data without the need for a third party.
I’ll explain how in a moment.
The data structure of a blockchain is what differentiates it from a normal database.
A blockchain groups information into blocks, which are just mini databases that record a transaction or encounter.
Take for example, a typical credit card transaction.
There’s a buyer, a seller, and good or service that was purchased.
All of this information describes the transaction, along with date information.
If this transaction was enacted through a system that was built on a blockchain, that transaction would be recorded in a block.
The next transaction would be recorded in the next block, and so on.
Along with storing data, blocks also store a hash value, which is a unique identifier for the block which represents all of the block’s contents.
Hashes are always unique, like fingerprints, and since the hash is based on the content of the block, if the content inside the block changes, the hash will also change.
This makes blocks tamper-proof, since there is no way to change the content inside a block without also changing the hash.
This is significant because each block also stores the hash of the block that came before it in the chain.
The very first block in the chain notes that it is the start, because there is no block before it.
The next block created would note the hash of the block behind it, which would be the first block, and store it.
Then the next – or third – block in our chain would note the hash of the second block, and so on and so forth.
Take, for example, the chain described above with three blocks.
If a malevolent actor went in and modified the middle block, this would change the hash of the block, which would then cause the third block to notice that the hash it stored of the previous block no longer matches that block’s hash.
If there were ten thousand more blocks after the third block, each would be able to validate the same finding, and the change would be overwritten since it didn’t pass validation of every other block in the blockchain.
While a blockchain structures data into blocks, a normal database does so into tables.
When a block is filled with data, it becomes part of a larger timeline, meaning that it is impossible to alter a single piece of data without overhauling the entire blockchain.
Thus, greater security is inherent in the design of a blockchain over that of a traditional database.
Blockchains are also decentralized, which means that no single, governing entity controls the state or validation of the blockchain.
How is a Blockchain Decentralized? To understand how blockchain decentralization works, we need an example.
Suppose that you own a company with 10,000 computers that are used to maintain a database containing the account information of your clients.
To house all of these units, you put them in a warehouse building.
All of them are under the same roof and you have complete control over each of those computers as well as the data inside.
The problem with this is that there are some points of failure.
What if the power goes out? What if the connection to the internet is lost? What if the entire place goes up in flames? What if a malicious individual got in and deleted everything? In any of those cases, all the data is corrupted or lost.
Here, a blockchain allows for better data protection in a number of ways.
It spreads out the database among many network nodes at different locations.
This accomplishes two things.
For one, How is a Blockchain Decentralized? To understand how blockchain decentralization works, we need an example.

Here, a blockchain allows for better data protection in a number of ways.
It spreads out the database among many network nodes at different locations.
This accomplishes two things.
For one, Achieving censorship would be nigh impossible if information distribution and storage is decentralized.
When all the data comes from a single source, it is easy to alter and censor certain pieces of it.
However, when the database is decentralized, there is no central authority that controls the data flow.
Think of it like trying to block a leak.
If there is only one hole, it’s easy.
You cannot say the same if there are a hundred holes.
For instance, social media platforms often regulate the kind of content you can upload.
They will delete offensive, provocative, or inappropriate content.
However, when you communicate on a decentralized platform, everybody can interact with no moderation.
Open Development Open-source developments are important for a number of reasons.
The most prominent one is the fact that everybody can see exactly how the program or system is being developed.
Decentralized networks typically sport open development environments.
With an open development environment, the network is able to offer superior products, tools, and services since the verification of edits to a blockchain is inherent in the architecture of the blockchain.
Open-source software is basically an open book.
Anyone can look at the codes behind the application and use or modify it as they see fit.
That ensures nothing shady is built into the code that could restrict user access and establish a single point of control.
An open development, decentralized blockchain makes these instance much easier to find.
Most major open-source software has its codes on GitHub, which is a code repository tool designed for open-source development.
What is a Digital Currency? Before we can understand what exactly qualifies as a digital currency, we need to know what the money we have in our pocket is called.
Currencies issued by the government are called fiat currencies.
These are physical representations such as coins and paper money that hold a certain value, which you can trade for goods and services.
When fiat currencies are stored digitally, they become digital currency.
This is an early form of digital cash, which can be transferred between bank accounts and is in use today in the form of credit or debit cards, wire transfers, online payments, etc.
Cryptocurrencies are categorized as digital currencies as well.
Bitcoin is the first-ever cryptocurrency and was privately developed as a way to exchange money on the internet independent of major financial institutions.
Since its debut in 2009, Bitcoin received a lukewarm reception.
Some investors believe it is a store of value whereas others remain skeptical to this day.
What is indisputable is the fact that there are now thousands of cryptocurrencies with different uses in the digital economy as well as that in the real world.
Governments across the globe are also considering creating their own digital currency.
Although fiat currency stored in digital form is technically a digital currency, it does not really equate to cryptocurrency.
The reason is that you can convert the digital currency in your bank account into cold, hard cash when you make a withdrawal.
You can use fiat currencies stored digitally to make purchases via electronic payments using a card or online payment methods.
Money in its current form is distributed by major financial institutions such as a central bank.
This is a centralized process where one institution produces the notes and assigns a system of serial numbers to them to make them unique.
The partners of the institution would then inject the cash into the economy through various means.
True digital currencies work differently.
They utilize a network of computing nodes to process transactions.
Then, cryptography would be used to anonymize the user and the details of the transaction.
All activities on the network would be recorded on an electronic ledger and every node, as in every computer, on the network would have a copy.
An electronic ledger functions similarly to a traditional public ledger.
It is a record-keeping system.
It records the user’s identities, in this case as pseudonyms, their balances, and transactions.
Think about sending your friend some cash.
If you send $100 to them, a couple of things happen.
That $100 would be deducted from your account, and its balance would be updated to reflect that, then your friend would receive $100 in their account, and its balance would also be updated.
At the same time, the accounting system ensures that your account actually has enough balance to make that transfer.
One thing that makes digital currencies so favorable is the fact that they can be transferred to another user directly without any intermediaries, whichWhat are Coins and Tokens? In the context of cryptocurrency, a coin is basically a representation of a currency within a blockchain.
Coins do not really serve any utility functions other than to be a digital item to be traded, with a value varying depending on the current market conditions.
Coins can also be exchanged for tokens on another blockchain network through private transfers or a cryptocurrency exchange.
We’ll get to tokens in a moment.
Many startup cryptocurrency companies conduct their fundraiser operations via an Initial Coin Offering before they establish their own blockchain.
Most ICOs are usually performed on the Ethereum network and users can pledge their coins (in this case, Ether) in exchange for tokens.
This is similar to how an Initial Public Offering is conducted, when a previously private company gets listed on a public stock exchange.
These tokens have utilities, which vary depending on what the startup wants you to do with them.
Since crypto tokens require a blockchain network and making one is an expensive process, most startups resort to using Ethereum’s blockchain network for the job.
Although most ICOs accept Bitcoin and Ether, some also allow you to pledge other cryptocurrencies as payment.
What exactly are crypto tokens, then? While coins represent a unit of currency, tokens represent tradable and fungible assets or utilities for that specific blockchain network.
While tokens are often distributed to ICOs funders, they can also be used for other purposes.
Tokens are created, distributed, and traded through ICOs.
What is the Difference? Now, things might get muddy here and a lot of people cannot really tell the difference between cryptocurrency, crypto coins, and crypto tokens.
But this might clear things up for you.
A cryptocurrency is basically an umbrella term that covers both tokens and coins.
For instance, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and it has both virtual tokens and coins that you can trade, or with which you can make purchases.
So, what is the difference between tokens and coins? Coins are strictly used to make purchases.
They work like a legal tender, basically money.
Tokens, on the other hand, are a denomination of a cryptocurrency.
They are tradable assets or utilities that you can use to either trade for other tokens or coins.
Alternatively, you can hold onto it to access various benefits offered by the underlying blockchain network.
These benefits are decided by the company offering the tokens through their ICO, and you can find the details in their “whitepaper”, which is essentially their sales pitch.
One way to look at crypto tokens is to compare them to stocks in a company.
While you can sell stocks to make money and then spend that money the same way with fiat currencies, you also reap benefits from the stock in your portfolio – namely, dividends.
This is the main difference between tokens and coins.
Tokens can represent your stake in the company you helped fund through their ICOs and they have far more utility than coins.
Coins are just used to make purchases.
Why is Blockchain Technology Important and Where Will It Take Us? While blockchain technology is frequently associated with cryptocurrencies, the technology itself has far more uses than facilitating the transfer of wealth through a decentralized network.
Both the technology and cryptocurrencies are often discussed together and some might think that blockchains would not exist without cryptocurrency, but the opposite is actually true.
Cryptocurrencies would not be as popular or widely used as they are today without the underlying blockchain technology.
There are many benefits that the blockchain technology gives us, including efficiency, affordability, security, transparency, immutability, and digital freedom, as we have discussed so far.
That is all fine and dandy, but what is stopping it from widespread adoption if it is so great? Blockchain Maturity Problem The blockchain technology is relatively new, which is perhaps the biggest reason why it has not received widespread adoption.
Given that switching to blockchain networks can be costly and risky if you already have a functioning business model, people are a bit anxious to become the early adopter.
There have been a few high-profile players who declared that they would give blockchain a chance, but people are still reluctant.
Moreover, this technology may not be the solution for every single industry out there.
While the financial sector has much to benefit from this technology, the list of benefits is quite short for other sectors such as education.
Blockchain technology is disruptive.
Its implementation and management will  like the dollar with the decentralized settlement assurance of the public blockchains.
In short, they allow you to move and settle arbitrary amounts of fiat currency anywhere over the Internet with strong fidelity and few of the encumbrances of the traditional banking system.
A section of economists hold these stablecoins in high regard because they believe stablecoins can result in a cost-effective, safe, and more competitive payment gateway that works in real time.
Stablecoins can also connect the underbanked or unbanked sections of society through their digital reach.
How Are Governments Reacting to This Disruption? Governments all around the world have varied opinions about the rise of stablecoins.
Some of them want to project them as nothing but the next big scam, while others are in the process of figuring how to integrate them into the wider economy.
The pros and cons of stablecoins can be debated to great extents, but their growing popularity cannot be ignored anymore.
Gary Gensler, the chair of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, commented at a conference in August 2021 that the time had come to regulate the cryptocurrency markets.
The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, urgently called for regulating stablecoins.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen even stated that stablecoins “had the potential to support beneficial payment options”.
People of such high economic significance only comment about things that really matter.
These comments indicate that the government views stablecoins as a legitimate digital currency which is going to play an important role in the future of global finance.
The Federal Reserve governor has indicated the government's plan to explore a Central Bank Digital Currency as a response to the rising popularity and strength of stablecoins.
A CBDC is a type of fiat currency in digital form.
Since it is issued by the central bank of a country, it has the faith of the issuing country's government.
CBDCs are still undergoing developments in various parts of the world, and once done, they are expected to simplify the implementation of fiscal and monetary policy.
The government's initiative in developing CBDCs proves the fact that they are intimidated by the rapid development of stablecoins.
They might look at it as an act of countering the stablecoin, but in reality, they are acknowledging its existence and rising importance.
The Growth of the Terra Ecosystem and Luna New stablecoins are coming into existence every other day, and Terra is one which has gained popularity quite quickly.
Terra is a blockchain payment platform for algorithmic stablecoins.
It helps the users to save, spend, trade, or exchange Terra stablecoins instantly on its blockchain.
The main purpose of the Terra protocol is to track the price of any fiat currency such as euros or US dollars.
The network has two main cryptocurrency tokens, Terra and Luna.
Let's briefly discuss their features: Terra: This is the token that tracks the prices of individual currencies.
Each token tracking a particular currency is named after that currency.
For instance, the Terra token that tracks the Special Drawing Rights issued by the IMF is called TerraSDR and the one that tracks dollars is called TerraUSD.
Luna: Luna absorbs the price volatility of Terra, acting as the staking token.
It is used for governance and mining.
Luna's worth is linked to Terra's usage.
DeFi 2.0 One huge crypto trend which hasn’t made its way to mainstream reporting is DeFi 2.0.
This is the second generation of decentralized finance protocols that expanded on the utility of the first generation ones which gave us things like crypto lending, yield farming and market making abilities on the blockchain.
The majority of DeFi 1.0 limitations were based around the limitations of the protocols themselves, which led to a poor user experience (making onboarding difficult for all but the most dedicated of enthusiasts).
Much of this revolves around the scaling issues that Ethereum has faced in the past 3 years, as many DeFi 1.0 projects were built on Ethereum.
DeFi 2.0 aims to do for the DeFi movement, what Coinbase did for the mainstream cryptocurrency exchange movement.
Provide a more streamlined, simple solution which is more in-lineWe see DeFi 2.0 as having far more business to business utility, with projects like OlympusDAO aiming to build a decentralized reserve currency.
The real gamechanger here is being able to scale crypto lending operations (because right now the problem is that there are simply more lenders than borrowers) as well as provide a more consistent cash flow for the ecosystem, which in turn will reduce volatility.
DeFi 2.0 will also mean more competition for Ethereum going forward, with Solana (SOL) being a frontrunner due to its low-cost, high speed, and scalable alternative to Ethereum.
These inherent features, paired with composability, have helped Solana cement itself as a choice platform of DeFi 2.0.
Other Areas of the Financial Sector Where Blockchain Can Make Its Mark The gradual rise of altcoins and blockchain technology has made it clear that this will leave a significant mark on the financial sector.
The benefits of this technology make it a perfect fit for a variety of financial operations, and that is why we have listed the following sectors which we believe will be positively affected by blockchain and crypto: Stock Market Settlements: Blockchain is set to revolutionize stock market settlements by reducing the time taken for transaction processing and improving the efficiency of trading.
It will result in lower operational costs, and smart contracts will ensure greater efficiency and security.
NASDAQ already uses blockchain for private placement, and the London Stock Exchange is exploring areas where they can apply the technology.
Asset Management: With the growth of global trade, the importance of asset management is increasing all over the world.
In fact, the asset management industry is among the fastest-growing ones in the world and is expected to grow by $150 trillion by 2025 (Jain, 2020).
Right now, the asset management network follows a centralized system that enables the users to view the assets held on a real-time basis.
However, the system is migrating to a distributed ledger system for easier access and management.
This is where blockchain technology comes into the picture.
This system will help in the faster processing of cross-border transactions and ensure error-free processing of data.
Efficient Payments: Blockchain technology can bring about serious improvements in the payment processing systems of banks or other financial institutions.
Transactions that used to take more than a week to be processed can now be instantly transferred with the help of blockchain.
Since it removes the requirements of intermediaries and money can be transferred directly between individuals, blockchain will save time and money.
Central banks of many countries are trying to implement a distributed ledger system that will improve settlement fidelity and operational risk.
Compliance Processes: Know Your Customer (KYC) is an essential element of the entire financial sector.
Every country has elaborate KYC compliance requirements, which create a huge workload for the people employed in these institutions.
Using blockchain services like KYC-chain will help the companies to streamline this process.
Bankers will be able to check the KYC details on a real-time basis, which would subsequently reduce data duplication and improve work efficiency.
The customer identification process will be automated and banks will have a digital source of ID that can be accessed on a decentralized platform by any authorized personnel.
Fraud-Free Insurance Claim Management: Blockchain is helping the insurance industry by developing a fraud-free system where claims can be sorted automatically with the help of smart contracts.
It links all concerned parties of an insurance contract, like broker, client, insurer, and insured, resulting in efficient and transparent communication.
CRYPTO CLOUD COMPUTING We briefly discussed Web 3 in a previous chapter.
In this section, I would like to tell you a bit more about our views about Web 3 and what it means for cryptocurrency investors.
It is my prediction that  the Web 3 era is the third phase of the crypto market and it can make cryptocurrencies more mainstream than ever.
I believe that it has the potential to be an event that grows the value of the entire cryptocurrency market 100x from here.
Mind you, it won't happen overnight, but I think the expected ramifications are massive.
The Rise of Web 3 Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreesen Horowitz and considered one of the smartest venture capitalists of this generation, speaks very highly about Web 3 and the future it holds for us.
In a 2021 blog post titled Why Web3 Matters, Dixon surmised: “We are now at the beginning of the web 3 era, which combines the decentralized, community-governed ethos of web 1.0 with the advanced, modern functionality of web2.0”.
Right now, we still largely exist in a web 2.0 world where giant corporations own huge chunks of the internet, and your data, Google and Facebook being the 2 which immediately spring to mind.
While these companies have been a net positive for society over the past 2 decades, we are now seeing the tide shifting against them, and a further move towards decentralization.
Web 3 facilitates a decentralized platform using blockchain technology which allows users to use the internet without their data being stored in a centralized hub or owned by a single corporation.
The biggest problem with centralized platforms is that they limit innovation after a certain point.
These platforms are completely dependent upon third-party complements like developers, creators, and businesses.
The centralized networks work in such a way that they need to keep on extracting data from their users and former partners if they wish to grow.
For the third parties involved, this indicates a switch from cooperation to competition, which makes them wary.
Chris Dixon says that these issues are making the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors turn away from centralized platforms.
However, this is good news for Web 3, because these shortcomings of Web 1 and Web 2 are paving the way for the digital superiority of Web 3.
Web 3 has decentralized ownership and control, and tokens allow users to own a piece of the Internet.
Web 3 marks the beginning of an era when cryptocurrency companies can compete with and replace the largest technology companies in the world through the use of blockchain technology.
Here's what it looks like in practice.
A "Phase 3" crypto called Internet Computer (ICP) mimics many of the most advanced features of major cloud services like Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure.
So, you can deploy websites, enterprise IT systems, and Internet services much like you would with Amazon or Microsoft's cloud hosting.
However, here's what's going to bend your mind a little bit.
With the Internet Computer, you can deploy your code directly to the Internet itself through blockchain, and there will be no intermediary like Amazon or Microsoft.
This technology that was pioneered by Bitcoin is hitting a new inflection point in its capabilities by allowing people to lend their computing resources.
If you're still having doubts about why Web 3 is the future, here are a few reasons why they matter: The decentralized system makes societies efficient by removing the third parties and reducing the cost associated with managing these intermediaries.
This will result in greater value creation for the people who are the real users and developers of data.
The new mesh of peer-to-peer communication will enable organizations to become more resilient to change.
Sharing of data between humans, enterprises, and machines will become more efficient through the privacy and security of the blockchain network.
Tokenized digital assets will enable the users to own their data and digital footprints.
Theta and Decentralized Video Streaming Theta (THETA) blockchain provides a decentralized platform and a "Phase 3" crypto which provides a solution to delivering video content across the Internet without depending on data centers.
Most Internet traffic is filled with video content, and the numbers will only continue to rise in the future because everyone is looking for real-timeupdates about what's going on.
Websites providing video-streaming content have mostly used a centralized system, which has been largely dependent upon the data centers located close to you.
Over time, this has become a problem due to connectivity issues and pressure on the system has made the quality of streaming slow and choppy.
A possible remedy to this might be a content delivery system where a group of servers will be dispersed so that the system is not burdened too much, but this can be a costly affair.
Theta is building a cryptocurrency solution to this problem by setting up a peer-to-peer network that aims at utilizing unused bandwidth.
When you are trying to view content on the Theta network, part of the data will come from the network itself and the rest will be delivered from the unused computing power of other nodes.
This is not some pie-in-the-sky dream because the co-founders of YouTube and Twitch TV are on the Theta team along with backing from Sony, Google, and Samsung.
This makes it a massive market opportunity.
The means of earning profit is not through a company like Fastly but a cryptocurrency like Theta.
In my opinion, the bottom line is that we are now starting to see Web 3 projects that are seeing real world utility, and will profitably reward investors.
We have the option of waiting until the market matures and bringing it to our readers when there is potentially less risk but also a lot less upside.
The other option is to alert our members about these developments when they're in what we believe is truly the "ground-floor" stage.
I hope readers would appreciate us doing so because we are certain this could transform the industry drastically.
CRYPTO IN VIDEO GAMES Imagine what it would be like to live in a world where people could make little or even a lot of money by simply playing video games.
Video games have been one of the most profitable industries of the last decade with stocks like Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), and Sea Limited (SE) providing heavy returns to investors.
Now, a combination of video games and crypto is set to light a fire under a new wave of profitable investments.
If I asked you to guess what the fastest-growing video game of 2021 was, you would probably say the latest Call of Duty or a viral sensation like Among Us.
However, the correct answer might take you by surprise because it is something you might not have heard about: Axie Infinity.
Axie Infinity’s Phenomenal Rise Axie Infinity was developed by an obscure Vietnamese developer named Sky Mavis.
Axie Infinity is about trading and battling Pokemon-like creatures called Axies, which are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs – more on those later), and players are earning thousands of dollars just by playing.
The game has become so popular that within three years, it was valued at over $3 billion after receiving a $152 million funding round from Andreesen Horowitz (Newton, 2021).
Nobody knew that playing video games could fetch a meaningful income, which is what made Axie Infinity so well-received and led to the platform’s revenue increasing 3000-fold in 2021.
Figure 7: Axie Infinity monthly revenue in 2021 (source: AxieWorld) Previously, we highlighted Skillz (SKLZ) to members of our Capital Gains Multiplier mentorship program.
Skillz utilizes a similar play-to-earn concept with fiat currency.
Here is an example of how play-to-earn has the ability to change people’s lives for the better.
John Aaron Ramos from the Philippines is a 22-year-old who became viral when he shared pictures of his two homes, which he bought from the money earned by playing Axie Infinity.
These stories are uplifting because the players are mostly young.
Sky Mavis stated that 25% of the players of Axie Infinity never had a bank account before and Axie wallets were the first financial services they were able to access.
You can learn about more Axie Infinity stories by watching the short documentary Play-To-Earn on YouTube.
It’s well worth it if you’re interested in finding out more about the human side of this project.
From an investor standpoint, managing partners at Andreessen Horowitz feel  very hopeful about the concept that Axie Infinity has brought about.
According to them, people would love to grab an opportunity that allows them to earn money while enjoying themselves through a game.
Axie Infinity is defining a new category, and this mechanism will find itself used repeatedly in future gaming generations.
The Potential Bullish Thesis Let me tell you why I am particularly optimistic about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in gaming.
At the time of writing, the entire process of playing Axie Infinity is quite complicated.
Their website shows an elaborate eight-step process for players to download the game, quite different from a typical onboarding process where you tap 2 buttons and the game installs right in front of you.
Despite the complexity, the game generated more than $1 billion in revenue from in-game transactions in 2021 and became the biggest user of the Ethereum blockchain in the process.
What is even more staggering is the company did this with just 600,000 users.
Compare that to a traditional video game, Candy Crush, which generated a similar revenue in 2020, yet required 273 million users to do so.
The potential upside is massive, especially as the company just launched its own sidechain (a separate blockchain which runs parallel to Ethereum), which allows players to lower transaction fees by avoiding the main Ethereum blockchain.
It is safe to say that cryptos and blockchain make the future of gaming look quite bright.
 Many people who enter the crypto space do so in the hopes of becoming rich overnight.
However, if you want to profit long term from crypto, it is important to focus less on the day-to-day swings of Bitcoin and Ethereum and instead look at companies who are set to benefit no matter which coins are surging.
The following 3 stocks are what we call “picks and shovels” plays – because they are directly involved in facilitating cryptocurrency development or transactions, without being having direct involvement with the cryptocurrencies themselves.
This investing strategy is named after the tools used to mine for gold during the California Gold Rush.
Before prospectors could even find gold, they needed to buy a pick and a shovel so that they could mine for it.
So while there was no guarantee that the individual prospector would find gold, the companies that sold picks and shovels were earning revenue regardless.
COINBASE (COIN) Coinbase has now become synonymous with cryptocurrencies across the world.
Since Coinbase is the biggest and most trusted cryptocurrency exchange, if it were to offer crypto applications through its interface, then most Americans would consequently see these applications as trustworthy.
Brief History and Development Founded in July 2012 by former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong, Coinbase was first funded by Y Combinator.
The creation of Coinbase was a milestone event in the history of the cryptocurrency industry because it was the first medium that was accessible to the general public.
It was started as a medium to buy and sell Bitcoin, but today it offers more than 21 products and operates in over 100 countries.
It has more than 68 million verified users.
This is a huge number in comparison to Wells Fargo, which has 70 million clients, and Bank of America, which has 66 million clients.
How Coinbase Earned Its Position Over the years, Coinbase has played the role of a cryptocurrency kingmaker because of the phenomenal appreciation of the assets listed on the exchange.
The boom of the crypto market paired with the excellent services provided by Coinbase in terms of security, ease of use, and regulatory compliance has made it the most important figure in the crypto industry.
The company has become an authoritative figure whose stamp of approval is synonymous with authentication.
As a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase is of enormous significance because it has made people realize that cryptocurrency is more than a means of exchange and it has real investment value.
Coinbase has played an important role in making cryptocurrencies a part of our daily lives by introducing Coinbase cards in the USA, UK, and EU.
This Visa debit card is a crypto wallet that will enable anyone to withdraw cash from the ATM by converting crypto into the desired fiat currency.
Cryptocurrency exchanges have been notorious for being hacked due to a general lack of security.
Coinbase has always been a step ahead in this regard because they hold and insure all the assets held by them.
It stores most of the crypto assets in offline cold storage vaults so that the risk of hacking is reduced and the remaining assets are insured by Lloyd's of London.
The American users' funds in USD wallets are covered by the FDIC and insured up to $250,000.
Coinbase ensures to provide a secure trading platform to all its users, which is what has made it a commercially successful company with solid profit margins.
What Are the Possible Hurdles? Despite the many benefits of Coinbase, it is not free from its share of hurdles.
The company has been actively engaging with SEC about their lending program called Lend, which would enable the users to lend the USDC that they hold on the Coinbase platform.
The SEC refuses to approve the program by stating that Lend is classified as an "investment contract" rather than a traditional lending program, which means they believe there is an inherent risk on the part of the borrower.
However, Coinbase argues that the customers will earn interest from their participation, which will be paid regardless of the broader business objectives of the company.
These regulatory hurdles become a greater problem since other crypto companieshave been running lending programs for years without seeking approval from the SEC.
Moreover, with time Coinbase and Coinbase Pro are facing stiff competition from other crypto-asset exchanges like Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and Kraken.
Understanding the Future and the Risks Associated with Investing in Coinbase Stock Coinbase has always believed in bringing economic freedom to the users of cryptocurrencies.
They were the first website to simplify buying and selling cryptocurrencies, and they intend to do the same with NFTs.
Coinbase has announced its NFT with the aim of minting, purchasing, and trading NFTs with ease.
The company has always been a trendsetter and continued to do so when they opted for a direct listing on the NASDAQ exchange instead of an IPO.
This non-traditional yet trendy choice was apt for Coinbase since they have been the pioneers of non-traditional cryptocurrencies for the last decade.
However, there are certain inherent risks associated with the Coinbase stock, in case you are thinking of investing.
The company is heavily dependent on retail cryptocurrency trading, which comprises 82% of its total revenue.
If you add institutional trading to that, 87% of the company's total revenue will be dependent on cryptocurrency trading volumes, which have historically been very volatile (Sigalos, 2021).
What’s more is, the price of the stock moves in line with the price of Bitcoin itself, as it is the most dominant coin on the market.
Figure 8: The heavy correlation between the price of Coinbase stock and the price of Bitcoin itself (Source: Ycharts) Another factor affecting Coinbase going forward is the continued competition in the cryptocurrency exchange market.
At the time of writing, Coinbase’s market cap of $49 billion is around 2% of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies.
Compared to another brokerage stock in Charles Schwab which is around 0.38% the market cap of total US equities.
Alternatively, you could compare it to Nasdaq, whose stock is roughly 0.07% of total US equities.
So while the cryptocurrency market will inevitably increase in size over the next decade, I would not expect Coinbase stock to keep pace with it.
Due to the recent pullback, Coinbase stock is trading relatively cheaply (6.5x 2022 sales) compared to both Nasdaq (10.8x 2022 sales) and NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange (9.8x 2022 sales).
You can expect Coinbase to stay very unstable over the next 12 to 18 months but if you can build a position starting at a stock price below $220, then you will be setup nicely for the years to come.
SILVERGATE CAPITAL CORPORATION (SI) For generations, finance and trading have always been associated with banks.
The advent of cryptocurrencies and blockchains challenged this tradition by developing a decentralized network.
However, that does not change the fact that people still feel comparatively safer when a bank is involved.
Silvergate Capital Corporation understood this and grabbed the opportunity to become the first crypto bank in the world.
It has been a long-standing player in the financial market and has remained profitable for the past 21 years.
It provides financial infrastructure services to the participants of the digital currency space.
This relatively small crypto bank looks strong and shows ample promise for growth across multiple digital currencies including stablecoins.
In simpler terms, it is a custodian of crypto assets in addition to offering normal banking services.
It provides collateralized lending of Bitcoin, which is growing at a staggering rate of 25% per quarter.
Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) In 2017, the company wanted to target the unexplored digital currency network, which was why they introduced the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN).
Investors were overwhelmed due to the 24/7 trading hours of cryptocurrencies and were facing major problems in sending funds across various platforms because the trading timings varied from the normal banking hours.
Silvergate Capital Corporation addressed this problem by developing the first API-enabled real-time payment platform called SEN.
Since SEN is a two-sided network, it allows its members to conduct transactions all year round on a real-time basis.
This created a huge competitive advantage for both the users and participating networks, which attracted more people and exchanges to become a part of the cryptocurrency space.
SEN provides interest-free deposits and cross-sells additional services by capitalizing its first-mover advantage which is contributing to its rapid growth.
SEN is regarded as the core of the Silvergate Capital Corporation and is now recognized as an industry-leading payment network utilized by major crypto exchanges and institutional investors.
Opportunities in Lending and Stablecoins With the increased popularity of crypto lending, SI launched SEN Leverage, which allows users to get loans collateralized by bitcoins which are held at specified exchanges.
Their network allows them to process loans and repayments any time of the day.
They have associated themselves with Bitstamp Ltd to manage the cryptocurrency collaterals.
Although it is a relatively new part of SI, SEN has shown rapid growth by becoming 16% of their entire loan portfolio in comparison to 2% of the previous year (Analyst, 2021).
As a user, you get the benefit of flexibility and security since SEN maintains a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% and handles volatile cryptocurrencies by enforcing various risk control measures.
Stablecoin opportunities can become beneficial for SI as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) has announced a partnership with them.
SI will be the exclusive manager and issuer of the Diem USD stablecoin which will be introduced by Facebook.
The Diem network will include many high-profile customers like Coinbase, Uber, Lyft, Farfetch, and Spotify.
SI's association with Diem can mean increased income and profits through transaction fees and income on reserve deposits.
The Future Prospects SEN is a particularly successful segment since it has incurred zero losses and there have been no forced liquidations to date.
The company ended the quarter with 1,305 digital currency customers, up from 928 in the third quarter of 2020 and 1,224 in the second quarter of 2021.
The transfer volume on SEN reached $219 billion in Q4 of 2021, from which Silvergate was able to generate $9.3 million in transaction fees (Silvergate Capital, 2022).
However, you must not let the recent run-up fool you since this is still at a very early stage at just a $3.5 billion market cap.
In March 2021, SI announced its association with Fidelity Digital Assets as their custody provider.
This was a huge milestone for them since this would mean that institutional investors would be able to receive USD financing using the SEN and the collateral (the Bitcoin) will be held by Fidelity Digital Assets separately in a cold storage account.
Silvergate Capital Corporation also announced partnerships with major companies like PayPal and CME Group.
It provides a moving line of credit of $100 million to Marathon Digital, which makes it a good acquisition target for big banks, such as, J.P.
Morgan.
In terms of valuation, SI shows the potential of a quintessential growth stock with a forward price-earnings ratio of 36 and a forward price-sales ratio of 14.
The leadership position and value of the SEN as a fintech platform justifies the bullish valuation.
BLOCKCHAIN EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS (ETFS) The blockchain market has a compound annual growth rate of 50% since it is still in the early stages of development.
If you aren’t comfortable with investing in individual stocks, then Blockchain ETFs offer an efficient investment opportunity to put your money in a basket of stocks that specifically deal with blockchains.
Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) The Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) invests in companies that are set to benefit from blockchain adoption in their business operations.
They also invest in companies involved in digital asset mining, digital asset hardware, and blockchain digital asset integration.
It has a net expense ratio of 0.5%.
This fund is more mining and crypto-exchange focused and is heavily concentrated since almost 55% of the fund is invested in Coinbase, Marathon Digital, Hut 8 Mining, Riot Blockchain and Voyager Digital.
BKCH is more volatile than the other Blockchain ETFs discussed because the prices of mining stocks have a high correlation with Bitcoin prices.
Amplified Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) The fund has been around since 2018 and the majority of its holdings are in software which implies that it is more fintech related.
As of September 30, 2021, the top five companies in which this fund has invested are Hut 8 Corporation, MicroStrategy, Block (formerly known as Square), PayPal, and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc.
The fund has a net expense ratio of 0.71%.
Invesco CoinShares Global Blockchain UCITS ETF (BCHS) For our readers in the UK and EU, the best European Blockchain ETF is BCHS.
This ETF is listed in London and has over 1 billion GBP in assets under management.
The fund has a net expense ratio of 0.65% and the top 10 holdings include as mixture of both mining focused companies and FinTech companies like Hive Blockchain Technologies, Bitfarms Ltd, SBI Holdings Inc, Coinbase Global Inc, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, GMO Internet Inc, Monex Group Inc, Microstrategy Inc, and Kakao CorpTWO WAYS TO NOT GET EXPOSURE TO CRYPTO IN THE STOCK MARKET + ONE WAY WE’RE RECONSIDERING Crypto enthusiasts will keep telling you all the things that you should do to become a millionaire in this market.
However, there is no denying the fact that this market changes colors frequently and it is very difficult to predict anything with reasonable certainty.
Our suggestion has always been very straightforward: invest in crypto only if you feel you have the stomach for it and don't let the fear of missing out drive your decisions.
Just because the media or some tech-bloggers are hyping something does not mean you have to put all your money into it.
The crypto market is deceiving, which is why you should steer clear of these three things when you decide to become a part of this space.
PROSHARES BITCOIN STRATEGY ETF (BITO) After years of battling back and forth with the SEC to get regulatory approval, October 2021 saw the launch of the first-ever Bitcoin ETF located in the USA with the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) hitting the exchanges.
This was an achievement in itself because this was the first time in around eight years that a cryptocurrency proponent was able to secure a badge of legitimacy and authentication from the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).
It was the fastest ETF ever to reach $1 billion assets under management (AUM) by achieving this milestone within a day of its launch.
Why this ETF isn’t what it first appears The investment policy of the ProShares ETF mentions that its main objective is to achieve capital appreciation, by investing in Bitcoin futures contracts.
This means that the fund does not directly invest in Bitcoin, nor does it track the spot price of Bitcoin.
Therefore owning BITO is not like GLD, which provides ownership of gold by proxy.
Since the fund is giving you exposure to Bitcoin futures, the current price may not reflect the spot price of Bitcoin.
The ETF puts their money in cash-settled, front-month Bitcoin futures.
Front-month means contracts whose maturity dates are the soonest.
At the end of the month, the ETF will roll their Bitcoin futures over to the next month.
They can do this by selling the contracts of the current month and again buying contracts for next month.
This process continues, and as the price of futures changes, the value of the ETF fluctuates.
This process is known as "rolling yield." Here’s where the problem lies: shorter-term traders know that the ETF has to roll over its contracts, which is why these traders drive up the price of the coming month's contracts.
As a result, BITO is forced to pay a higher price for next month’s futures.
The rolling yield method is a direct impact of the constant state of Contango of the Bitcoin futures market.
Contango is a situation where the price of futures keeps on increasing as time passes, which means the fund has to sell the expiring futures at a lower price while buying new futures at a much higher price.
BITO already accounts for one third of the Bitcoin futures market, and it will only increase as time passes and more institutional investment goes into the fund.
Because of this, the ETF will be paying an 8-10% higher price for the fresh futures, which implies that you will be getting only $0.90 worth of Bitcoin for every $1 invested in the ETF.
Moreover, future prices are based on prevailing spot prices plus the cost of carry, which may be positive or negative depending on the demand and supply forces.
This makes the prices of the ETF unstable and might create problems for the investor.
BITWISE 10 CRYPTO INDEX FUND (BITW) Bitwise Asset Management is the world's largest crypto index fund manager, which introduced the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund.
It describes itself as something similar to the "S&P 500 of Crypto." This is supposed to be the first large-cap crypto index fund that exposes the investor to the so-called "exciting" world of crypto beyond Bitcoin.
It is another one of those "Bitcoin fund" type of deals and holds 84% Bitcoin and 11% Ethereum.
The remaining 5% is invested in 7 different cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Solana, Uniswap, and Despite the high claims made by the fund, it does not perform.
I say this because the fund has an insanely high expense ratio of 2.5%.
Funds that seek to correspond to the S&P 500 Index have expense ratios that range from only 0.015% to 0.09%, which is why it is quite evident that this comparison is completely unjustified.
Another issue with these funds is that they trade only Monday to Friday.
They have not yet reached the level of dynamism of crypto trading that is taking place 24/7.
This is an issue because of the associated volatility that comes with investing in the crypto market.
Imagine there is a major drop in Bitcoin prices over the weekend.
What happens to your investment in the BITW fund? You are left exposed because you won’t be able to makes any trades until the following Monday.
GRAYSCALE BITCOIN TRUST (GBTC) GBTC rose to popularity in 2020 as it was the most liquid way to get exposure to Bitcoin in a traditional retirement account like an IRA, Roth IRA or 401(k).
We previously discussed GBTC in our book The Only Bitcoin Investing Book You’ll Ever Need.
In that book, we discouraged readers from investing due to the high management fee and the fact that the fund was trading at a significant premium in relation to its Net Asset Value (NAV).
However, since then, we have seen an interesting phenomenon with GBTC.
Figure 9: GBTC swings from a heavy premium to a significant discount to NAV (Source: YCharts) As you can see, the fund spent the majority of 2021 (and continues into 2022) trading at a large discount to NAV.
Meaning instead of paying $1.20 for $1 worth of Bitcoin like you would have done at the beginning of 2021, at the time of writing you could buy Bitcoin for 79 cents on the dollar.
We still recommend direct Bitcoin ownership over everything else, but if you do want exposure to Bitcoin in your retirement account, then GBTC is worth buying only if the fund is trading at a significant WHAT THE "F" IS AN NFT? The rise of the digital world has given a twist to the art and collectibles industry.
That's right, blockchain has penetrated the world of art and collectibles as well, and right now we’ve seen a new wave of cryptoassets come to the forefront.
Let me introduce you to the world of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.
DECONSTRUCTING NFTS If you’re unfamiliar, then NFTs can seem confusing or downright bizarre.
Are people paying $100,000 for a JPEG image? Can’t you just copy that same image on your computer? Did Snoop Dogg really spend $17m on NFTs under the pseudonym Cozomo De Medici? The answer to that last one is, indeed, yes.
You can see Snoop Dogg’s NFT portfolio by going to https://Freemanpublications.com/snoopdoggwallet Figure 10: Cryptopunk #3100, an NFT which sold for 4,200 ETH ($7.58m) in March 2021 So what exactly IS an NFT? An NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, is a form of a digital asset that represents things like art, music, in-game objects, and videos.
They have the same underlying technology as cryptocurrencies—that is, blockchain.
NFTs have been around since 2014, but they have suddenly started gaining popularity for buying and selling digital artwork.
Over $174 million has been spent on NFTs since 2017 (Conti, 2021).
Connoisseurs, celebrities and speculators want access to something exclusive and to claim ownership over a piece of art that will not be replicated anytime soon.
The NFT craze is not just limited to art.
Remember those sports cards you used to collect as a child? They have now become digital and are represented as sports moments with movement and sound, and each of them is one of a kind.
This uniqueness is making collectors reach deep into their pockets to pull out millions of dollars without a second thought.
You might be wondering, what is so special about a sports clip? The same clip is being edited millions of times on all social media platforms.
People are making TikTok videos, reels, and whatnot with those clips, so why would somebody want to spend a fortune for it? Well, it might not make sense for you, but a crazy sports fan would take pride in owning the "original" clip.
These NFTs give the owner a kind of digital bragging rights, and for some people, that is worth a lot.
How Do NFTs Differ From Traditional Cryptocurrencies? The crypto world has two types of tokens, which are fungible and non-fungible.
All digital currencies are fungible tokens like physical money.
This means that the value of one bitcoin will always be equal to another.
Even if it is converted to dollars, the value will remain unchanged.
Non-fungible tokens are unique and one token cannot be exchanged for one another.
For example, Mike Winklemann, the famous digital artist also known as Beeple, crafted 5,000 daily drawings to create one of the most famous NFTs of the moment.
Known as "Everydays: The First 5000 Days," it was sold at $69.3 million (Copeland, 2021).
An NBA Top Shot of LeBron James sold for $250,000.
These two NFTs are different and there cannot be any exchange between the two.
How Do NFTs Work? Like cryptocurrencies, blockchain is the central technology of NFTs.
Although many other networks support them, NFTs are most commonly found on the Ethereum blockchain.
These tokens are created or "minted" from digital objects, which may represent art, GIFs, sports highlights, collectibles, video game skins, virtual avatars, designer sneakers, music, and any other tangible or intangible item.
An NFT is not much different from buying a painting from an art gallery.
Instead of hanging it in your living room, you get a digital file with the original artwork or collectibleownership is verified with the help of a unique digital signature, which is proof of authenticity.
What Are the Uses of NFTs? Artists have always had a hard time finding buyers for their art through galleries or auction houses.
Often, they do not get the price they are looking for.
Even if they do find a suitable buyer, much of the profit gets eaten up by intermediaries.
NFTs remove this barrier because they connect the artist directly with the consumer.
We are not here to talk just about art, which is why it is important to understand the benefits NFTs provide for investors as well.
The removal of intermediaries enables a buyer to pay the right price for their desired piece of art.
Moreover, NFTs have created a demand for some strange yet impactful things.
Popular brands like Taco Bell, Coca-Cola and Charmin have used NFTs to raise money for charity.
These tokens improve market efficiency by easily converting a physical item to a digital asset and assigning a suitable value to it.
If used correctly, NFTs have the potential to revolutionize complex investments like real estate.
Division of property can become much easier by assigning an NFT of each part of the property to every owner.
Decentraland is a virtual reality platform on the Ethereum network which has implemented a similar concept.
It is assumed that as NFTs become more developed, we will be able to implement the concept of tokenized pieces of land to physical real estate as well based on their value and location.
UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF NFTS The biggest reason why certain NFTs are so valuable is because of their scarcity.
Imagine waiting in line for a long time to buy something exclusive.
NFTs are simply the digital version of that same event.
As with many other collectibles, the value of NFTs is linked to their scarcity.
There is only one original version of the Mona Lisa, and if you wish to own it, you will have to pay its price.
NFTs derive their value from a similar logic.
Because they are rare or unique, they are often valued at millions of dollars.
Except, unlike physical art which is often replicated or faked, because of the underlying records stored on the blockchain, it is impossible to fake or duplicate an NFT because of their immutable transaction history.
The Four Components of NFT Value Scarcity cannot be considered as the only factor while determining the value of NFTs, which is why the following formula is often used to understand and deconstruct their value.
Depending on which asset the NFT represents, the following elements are used by the investors to figure out whether the token is worth spending money for.
Creators also consider these elements to check whether there is scope for increasing the value.
Value of an NFT = Utility + Ownership History + Future Value + Liquidity Premium Utility The utility is one of the biggest indicators of determining the value for any asset, and NFTs are no exception.
Two of the most popular items that determine utility in the world of NFTs are tickets and game assets.
A powerful and rare Crypto Space Battleship token was sold for $45,250 in 2019 (Chang, 2020).
This is also why Axie Infinity has taken off so much, because each Axie character functions as its own NFT, and as the Axie gains more powers within the game, it increases in value.
Another way to determine the utility of an NFT is determining whether this token can be used in any other application.
Although the chances of this happening are quite rare because there is an inherent lack of interoperability, if the space battleship could be used in another game, then its value would be high.
It must be noted that multiple applications do not signify exchange like a fungible token.
Right now, the NFT space is dominated by a few games, and to make the tokens universally acceptable, a massive ecosystem needs to be developed.
Ownership History The identity of the creator or issuer and previous owners of the NFT play a very important role in determining its value.
Digital art creators can consider partnering with companies with a high brand value to issue their tokens since a high ownership history is instrumental in increasing the price of the token.
The value of the NFT might also increase was previously owned by somebody influential.
Various marketplaces and trading platforms allow users and investors to track individuals who have made the most profit using NFTs.
Future Value The future value of an NFT has two components: valuation changes and future cash flow.
Since the financial market is highly driven by speculation right now, the future value can change drastically within a short span, which can become the main driver for the valuation of the NFT.
Scarcity and speculation can drive NFT prices like nothing else, which is what makes it one of the most important determinants of their value.
Liquidity Premium On-chain NFTs offer greater liquidity than off-chain ones.
For example, if an NFT is available on the Ethereum network, anyone holding Ether can easily trade in those NFTs and their risk of liquidity will be significantly reduced.
That is why investors like to invest in NFTs that have a high trading value.
Apart from all these factors, another important point that determines the value of NFTs is the individual investor's perception.
For example, for a crazy basketball fan, a clip of LeBron James dunking NBA Top Shots might be priceless, which can drive them to pay a very high amount for a so-called "useless" asset.
SNEAKY WAYS TO PROFIT FROM THE BOOM OF NFTS NFTs are still at their early stages, which is why there is a lot of speculation in this sector.
Like we keep saying, just because everyone else is doing it doesn't mean you have to spend money on NFTs as well.
Our suggestion is to not buy the NFTs themselves if you are not into collecting rare and collectible items.
The big meme NFTs like Crypto Kitties or Cyberpunks are highly manipulated, which is why you might end up buying something worthless.
Since the space is still relatively new, you have to do your research to understand the profit element in them.
Earning From NFTs if You Are a Creator For creators, NFTs are a great way to showcase their art to a bigger audience.
When Beeple's painting collage made a record at Christie's by selling at $69.3 million, the whole world understood that NFTs can mean something huge for creators of digital art.
Many people believe that paying millions for a link to a picture is nothing but a scam, but the consensus is that NFTs will revolutionize the whole art space.
Creators of sports cards can also earn a fortune by selling their NFTs.
Sports cards have always been extremely popular among their collectors, but physical cards have the risk of getting destroyed.
NFTs eliminate any such risks by tokenizing the cards.
Not just sports cards, creators of any rare collectibles can create their NFTs and sell them on the digital marketplace.
Companies involved in developing games have their eyes set on NFTs after the phenomenal success of Axie Infinity.
Gamers are famous for spending recklessly while playing, which is why the gaming industry can benefit a lot from NFTs.
World of Warcraft gold or Call of Duty loot boxes and other video game skins are already worth billions of dollars, and if any game thinks about selling in-game items as NFTs, it could boost their income tremendously (Leyes, 2021).
Trading NFTs Although we do not recommend trading directly in NFTs due to the inherent risks involved, you can give it a try if you feel you have enough knowledge about artsy collectibles and how this market works.
A Miami-based art collector named Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile sold a digital art piece by Beeple for almost 1,000 times its initial price (Fintelics, 2021).
The value of NFTs varies significantly, which means among two similar art pieces, one can be worth millions and another completely worthless.
This makes direct trading of NFTs difficult and unpredictable.
Earning Passive Income From NFTs If you are someone who has purchased an NFT on the spur of the moment and now don't know what to do with it, here are a few ways through which you can earn passive income from them: Renting Out NFTs: Many card trading games give the option of borrowing NFTs to increase their chances of winning.
These agreements are governed by smart contracts which will keep you safe when you rent your NFTs.
will be allowed to set the rental agreement, including lease rate and duration, so the whole deal stays under your control.
Royalties: As the creator of an NFT, you can mint it in such a way that it gives you a fixed percentage of royalty every time it is sold in the secondary market.
Smart contracts control the entire process and you don't have to worry about asking for royalties.
Staking NFTs: The combination of NFTs with decentralized finance allows you to "stake" your purchased NFTs, which is a process of locking your tokens and earning a subsequent yield from them with the help of a DeFi protocol smart contract.
Providing Liquidity: Decentralized finance gives you the option to provide liquidity by using your NFTs.
Where Can You Trade NFTs? The first step would be to have a cryptocurrency wallet through which the transactions will take place.
The good news is that because the vast majority of NFTs are on the Ethereum blockchain, then any wallet with Ethereum compatibility will suffice.
The most NFT friendly wallet is Metamask, which comes with features like a browser extension and the ability to set up multiple addresses.
The latter is useful if you would like to hold your NFTs in a separate wallet from your regular crypto holdings.
We have a video tutorial on setting up your Metamask wallet at https://freemanpublications.com/cryptotutorials Most NFT trades take place using cryptocurrency (usually Ethereum), so you would need the required currency as well.
These are the most popular digital marketplaces that facilitate buying and selling of NFTs: Open Sea.io: This is a digital platform that hosts a collection of rare items, and you can easily access them by creating an account.
You can also find popular artists by filtering by their sales volume.
Rarible: This platform uses Rari tokens for fees and other community rules.
Rarible is a democratic platform where you can easily access and trade NFTs.
Foundation: This is more of an exclusive platform where artists can only post their art after receiving an invitation from a collector.
These invitations are called "upvotes." Foundation has a high entry cost since artists have to purchase "gas" to mint NFTs.
This is a premium platform attracting collectors who can pay very high prices.
Chris Torres sold the famous Nyan Cat NFT through Foundation.
NFT-Specific Marketplaces: Certain NFTs trade directly on their own platforms like NBA TopShot, Larva Labs (CryptoPunks) and Axie Marketplace.
UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND INVEST IN THE PLATFORMS The barriers to entry in the NFT market are extremely low.
Anybody can create an NFT and obtain a digital certificate for it, which is why it is necessary to consider the following risk factors before investing in NFTs: NFTs might be subject to copyright issues.
Anybody can create a digital token from an asset, after which they are assigned a digital signature which acts as a verification.
However, this digital key is not a guarantee of initial ownership, which is what raises a question about their genuineness.
No formal rules and regulations are governing NFTs, which is why their price can change at the whim of the manipulators.
OpenSea issued a statement stating that one of their employees purchased NFTs knowing that they would be featured on OpenSea's front page.
After they were published, the prices of the NFTs were boosted and they sold them at a high profit.
This shows the amount of unregulated manipulation that exists in this market.
Since NFTs are still in a nascent phase, we recommend against trying to make money by trading NFTs themselves.
We preferred a picks and shovels approach where we invest in platforms like Solana and Polkadot that facilitate the sale of NFTs, rather than the NFTs directly.
Outside Shot Sports-related NFTs are extremely popular in this market, which is why an under-the-radar play is to buy stocks from sports teams with an NFT angle.
Suppose an NFT is created by Manchester United featuring Cristiano Ronaldo scoring the winning goal in a cup final.
There won't be any question about its rising values, and subsequently, the club to which the player belongs will also profit from this NFT.
That is why you can consider investing in stocks like Madison Square Garden (MSGE), Liberty Global (LBTY), Manchester United (LSE:MANU), and Juventus (BIT:JUVE).
In this way, you will be able to get exposure to NFTs without suffering from their volatility directly.
Despite the buzz around NFTs, it is still early to comment on their long-term viability right now.
If used properly, they have the potential to become a good virtual twin for a digital asset, especially in sectors like real estate, by easing the trading process, allowing simple divisions, and tracing its history and ownership.
Remember though that this is a highly speculative and volatile market, and that fundamental, technical, or economic factors often fail to impact NFT prices because everything is dependent upon demand.
Before investing, you should always consider the resale options.
An NFT might not fetch any value on resale if nobody wants it during the time you want to sell it, which makes it a bit dysfunctional as an investment.
Conduct thorough research and understand your priorities before making a decision.
9 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS FROM FIRST-TIME CRYPTO INVESTORS There is still a lot of gray area in the cryptocurrency market.
The majority of countries have yet to develop proper laws for regulating crypto.
Naturally, there is a lot of doubt about how to proceed with your investments and what the implications will be.
That is why in this chapter we will address some of the frequently asked questions from first-time crypto investors, especially concerning its taxation and future planning.
Even if you have invested in crypto before, the answers to these questions will come in handy when you are stuck.
Can I Own Bitcoin/Ethereum in My IRA? Investing in cryptocurrencies as a part of your retirement portfolio can be a good idea since it might result in substantially higher returns.
You have the option of investing in cryptos through a self-directed IRA because normal IRAs do not allow you to put your money in alternative assets.
The money that you deposit in this self-directed IRA will be invested to purchase cryptocurrencies instead of normal mutual funds.
For a Bitcoin IRA, you have to remember that a custodian like a bank or a financial institution ensures that your account is following the relevant rules and regulations.
The biggest advantage of a Bitcoin IRA is that you get the benefit of diversification since the value of cryptocurrencies is not linked with stocks.
Even if the stock market is going down, you have the chance to earn phenomenally high returns.
Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown huge growth over the last couple of years, and they are expected to continue this trend.
Investing in a Bitcoin IRA gives you tax benefits like a normal IRA.
If you decide to open a Bitcoin IRA, here are a few leading providers which will allow you to choose from a variety of cryptocurrencies to invest in: BitIRA Bitcoin IRA Equity Trust iTrustCapital Regal Assets (if you want to own more cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin) Please do your due diligence before converting anything over to a Bitcoin or Crypto IRA.
Especially be sure to take note of all fees associated with setting up and maintaining the account.
Self directed IRAs can be time consuming and expensive to set up (and even more so if you do things incorrectly).
This is not a financial decision that you want to make on a whim.
Can I Own Cryptocurrency in a 401(k) Account? Technically, it is possible, but if you are under an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, you will not be allowed to put that money in cryptocurrencies.
This is because employer-sponsored plans are covered by the ERISA fiduciary rules, which protect the investors from the volatility of large losses.
Since the primary objective of a 401(k) account is to save money for retirement, the ERISA fiduciary rules ensure that the money in this account is kept safe.
However, if you are a self-employed person sponsoring your retirement through a Solo 401(k), you can choose to invest a part of it in cryptocurrencies.
QUESTIONS REGARDING TAXABILITY OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES First of all, I would like to clarify that we are not tax professionals.
We are here to talk about cryptocurrencies and are not providing tax advice.
We recommend that you consult your local professional when you are filing your tax returns because there may be certain issues that are specific to you.
There is still huge confusion about the taxability of cryptocurrencies.
Cryptocurrencies are yet to receive the status of "medium of exchange," so they are not taxed in the exact same way as stocks are.
Do I Have to Pay Taxes on My Crypto Gains? Yes, you do.
The IRS (and HMRC in the UK) treats capital gains on cryptocurrency the same way they treat stocks.
They are considered as personal assets of the holder.
When you sell cryptocurrencies, you have to pay capital gains on the amount of profit that you earned.
Gambling wins are exempt from tax in the UK, but cryptocurrency transactions are not considered gambling, which is why you must pay taxes on the gains.
It is not considered a currency since it is not issued by any central bank.
If you are holding crypto for less than 365 days, you will have to pay short-term taxes on the gains.
Long-term capital gains will be taxed if you are holding the currencies for a longer period.
Which Crypto Transactions Are Taxed? The IRS considers the following transactions related to cryptocurrencies as taxable: Selling cryptocurrency which you have personally mined to a third party.
If you have mined cryptocurrency and sold it to a third party for a profit, then that profit will be liable for capital gain taxes.
Selling cryptocurrency to a third party which you have purchased.
If you have bought cryptocurrencies from an exchange and sold them to a third party for a profit, then you will be paying capital gains taxes on it.
Buying goods or services with cryptocurrency which you have mined.
For example, if you purchased a pizza using cryptocurrency that you mined, then that transaction will attract capital gains taxes.
The amount of taxes will depend on the nature of the transaction and the value of cryptocurrency in comparison to that of the pizza.
Buying goods and services with cryptocurrency which you have bought.
If you purchased cryptocurrencies from an exchange and subsequently used the same for buying some goods or services, such a transaction will attract capital gain taxes.
In the second and fourth scenarios, it is a lot like investing in an asset.
However, for the cases where you are mining the cryptocurrency, you may be able to get deductions for any expenses which you have incurred during the mining process.
Does a Cryptocurrency Miner Have to Pay Taxes? As mentioned above, the mining of cryptocurrencies is a taxable event and the fair market value will be the current value of the currency at the time of being mined.
If you are in the business of cryptocurrency mining, then you can claim the expenses that you have incurred like resources, software and save big bucks on your taxes.
However, if you have mined the coins for personal benefit, you will not be getting any deduction.
Are Cryptocurrency Conversions Taxed? Conversions between Bitcoin and Ether, or between any other currencies, were considered as a like-kind transfer and income tax on such transactions could be deferred as per the permissions of the IRS.
However, the IRS put a stop to it after they found rampant exploitations of this provision.
It was stated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that like-kind transactions could take place only in real estate.
However, if you transfer cryptocurrency from one wallet to another, it will not be considered a sale and hence no capital gains will be attracted.
What Happens When There Is a Hard Fork in the Blockchain? A hard fork is an incident when a blockchain undergoes a protocol change and the old cryptocurrencies on the network are dropped.
A new coin is created which is different from its predecessor in mining and features.
Holders of the original cryptocurrency may be allotted new coins, and this phenomenon is called an airdrop.
IRS clarified that there are no tax implications of a hard fork, but when the holder receives units of a new cryptocurrency, it results in gross income and is subsequently taxed as normal income.
What Happens When I Donate, Gift, or Inherit Cryptocurrencies? The donation of crypto is treated the same way as cash donations.
The amount of gain as calculated by an appraiser during the time of donation will not attract any tax.
Gifts of cryptocurrencies below $15,000 are not subject to tax but will be taxed once this limit is exceeded.
Inheritance of cryptocurrency is treated the same way as other estate assets.
Filing and Reducing Crypto Taxes In our years of academic and practical experience, we have gathered knowledge about the tax filing process, which we are sharing with you.
Please consult your tax advisor regarding your particular tax situation.
Keep a record of all transactions: The IRS has made it mandatory for every person to keep a record of cryptocurrency transactions.
This will include details of your purchases, how long you have held the currencies, and records of every transaction where you used crypto to buy any goods or services.
Your crypto exchange will provide a 1099-B form to both you and the IRS as a report of your transactions, but this might not include the transactions you made between offline cold wallets.
You can use the help of software packages like Koinly or Cointracker, which help you to track all your cryptocurrency transactions across all blockchains, even if they are not on the network.
Fill out the proper forms: If you are making transactions in cryptocurrencies, you must fill out the correct forms to avoid penalties.
Depending on how you are using crypto, there are various forms to fill.
Form 8949 logs crypto as an investment where you have to enter the number of coins held, date and price of purchase and sale, and the amount of loss and gain.
Schedule D will summarize all your capital gains, including ones from crypto.
If you have mined cryptocurrencies, you have to disclose details in Schedule C.
In case you have mined coins as a hobby, you have to disclose that in Schedule 1.
File your taxes: Using a software package like Koinly or Cointracker will help you to keep track of all the transactions, and then you can link this record to your main federal and state tax form.
You can also choose to opt for a package like TokenTax, which is an integrated solution for both your cryptocurrency and regular taxes.
They will provide you with assistance with the entire thing.
If all these discussions about taxes are making you anxious, don't worry.
Here are a few ways through which you can save on cryptocurrency taxes in the future: Holding your cryptocurrencies for a longer term will help you save a lot on taxes.
Depending on how much you have earned during the year, your short-term capital gains rate is around 37% while your long-term rate will be lower.
So just by retaining the investments for a longer period, you can cut your tax rate significantly.
The main reason why people hold cryptocurrency investments is to take advantage of the volatility and cash in profits when the market is at a high.
If you are thinking about selling a huge chunk of your holdings for profit, take a look at your other investments and see if you are incurring heavy losses in any of them.
If your other holdings (whether crypto or not) are at a loss, then you can sell those during the same year to offset the gains from your crypto investment sale.
When you invest in crypto funds or ETFs through retirement accounts like self-directed IRA or 401(k), you get the benefits of tax deferment 10 COMMON CRYPTO SCAMS TO WATCH OUT FOR Whenever something new pops up, there are always bad actors snooping around to make a quick buck.
Along with all the good investment, this industry has also become home to a variety of fraudsters and scammers.
According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Consumer Sentinel, from October 2020 through March 31, 2021, reports of crypto-related scams skyrocketed to nearly 7,000 people reporting losses of more than $80 million.
These figures reflect a 12-fold increase in the number of reports compared to the same period a year ago and a nearly 1,000% rise in reported losses (Liebkind, 2021).
In this chapter, we will talk about the various scams that the cryptocurrency industry is seeing so that you don't fall prey to them.
USE OF AUTHORITY FIGURES AND POP CULTURE One trend which I have been noticing in the past few months is that people who used to sell real estate seminars or forex seminars have suddenly become "experts in cryptocurrencies" and are more than eager to show you how much they have gained in the last two or three months.
If you have come across such people, take a thousand steps back from them and think about the big picture.
Look for people who have been doing this for years, not months.
People are always jumping on the bandwagon, which is why you will find 20-year-old kids who have made a couple of trades turning into self-proclaimed gurus.
Here are two such very common methods of scamming people in the crypto market: Use of Authority Figures The Federal Trade Commission reports that Elon Musk Impersonators have made more than $2 million in recent years as a part of various cryptocurrency scams.
The nature of this scam is in the form of a "giveaway".
You will find tweets from famous personalities like Elon Musk, Barack Obama, or Joe Biden which will mention something about a giveaway.
The message will state that if you send cryptocurrencies to the given wallet, they will be multiplied immediately and returned to you.
People who have sent the currencies have done so to the wallet of a fraudster.
There is no giveaway or any scheme; impersonators create fake profiles for these authority figures and try to trick people into sending them cryptocurrency.
Once they receive the currencies, they sell them on any exchange to earn a profit.
Figure 11: A fake “Elon Musk” Twitter profile running a crypto scam.
Note the Twitter handle not matching the name Use of Pop Culture Using pop culture to trick people has become increasingly common in the cryptocurrency market.
This creates a golden opportunity for scammers who hype a pop culture-based currency to raise money from passionate investors.
After they have earned enough money, they simply vanish and there won't be any existence of the coin or the people who were initially promoting it.
Mando was one such cryptocurrency that was created around Disney-themed show The Mandalorian.
Even after losing thousands of dollars, people did not learn and they again got scammed through the Squid Game cryptocurrency.
We will discuss this one in detail in a later section of this chapter.
TYPES OF CRYPTO SCAMS In the previous section, we talked about what happens in the common cryptocurrency scams.
Now let's get into a bit more detail and discuss the various types of scams that have taken place.
Broadly, there are two categories of crypto scams: Trying to gain access to your crypto wallet.
This would include getting information that gives out details about your private key and is a form of hacking into your account.
Note: No cryptocurrency exchange will ever ask for your private key.
So be sure to watch out for phishing emails from scammers attempting to impersonate Coinbase or Binance.
Transferring crypto directly to the fraudster's account by impersonating someone or using fraudulent business opportunities.
Under these two broad categories, crypto scams take various other forms which we have discussed as follows: Social Engineering Scams These scams use manipulation and psychologically pressure the victims to gain information related to their crypto wallets.
The victims are made to believe they are dealing with a trusted person like a government agency, community member, colleague, or a reputed business.
The whole process is to mess with their minds so that they do not hesitate to share information or even send cryptocurrency directly to the scammer.
The various scams under this segment are: Romance Scams: Fraudsters use dating apps to make victims feel they are in a romantic relationship after which they ask for money from them.
Cryptocurrency transactions make up a huge part of these scams.
Imposter and Giveaway Scams.
Phishing Scams: They are a way to obtain information related to cryptocurrency wallets and private keys.
The process is that the victims receive emails that direct them to a specially curated website that tries to capture the above-mentioned information.
Blackmail Scams: Here the victim is blackmailed into providing information about private keys or transferring cryptocurrencies to the scammer's wallet.
They might also be given threats about unpleasant consequences if they failed to comply.
Business Opportunity Scams Always remember the phrase that if something is too good to be true, then it probably is.
There is no such thing as "get rich quick" or "make millions overnight" in the crypto market.
People who have made millions did so as a result of speculation.
Most of them had no idea or control over the fact that cryptocurrencies would make them rich.
That is why if you hear somebody claiming that they would make you rich or provide guaranteed returns in the crypto market, run in the opposite direction because it is a scam.
Pump and Dump Scams Pump and dump scams are nothing new.
They’ve plagued the stock market for years as scammers have artificially inflated the prices of penny stocks before cashing out.
This is a phenomenon where fraudsters first pump the price of a cryptocurrency by spreading false information about the currency and its prospects.
(Recall the example of DeTrade in Chapter 4.).
Then, after the price of the coin has been boosted, the fraudsters sell all their holdings to make a huge profit and leave the other investors at a loss for words and money.
These are now becoming increasingly common on social media with invitations to “insider trading” groups appearing in people’s direct messages on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
Some of these now blatantly advertise themselves as “pump groups”.
Figure 12: An example of a Pump and Dump group on Telegram and subsequent market activity on the targeted coin (Source: ResearchGate) These scams are also increasingly prevalent in the comment sections of cryptocurrency YouTube channels.
Remember if anyone approaches you on social media offering a get-rich-quick trading opportunity, avoid it like the plague.
A good rule of thumb is to remember that anyone promising that they know which crypto coin will pump next, likely has an ulterior motive.
Figure 13: An example of a Pump and Dump group recruiting message, sent via Instagram Fake Trading Scams Ever been approached by a “Bitcoin trader” on social media? Unfortunately this happened to one of our readers, who we’ll just call D.
D allowed me to share her story in full in order to prevent others suffering the same fate, so I’ve decided to re-print it here.
This was originally published in our daily newsletter on December 3rd 2021, to sign up to our newsletter just go to https://freemanpublications.com/bonus --- A reader, who I'll just call D, emailed me yesterday to ask if I had heard of a certain brokerage website.
I hadn't...
which automatically raises a red flag seeing as I do this for a living.
The website in question appears to be somewhat legit at first glance, claiming to be registered in Switzerland.
So I asked D why she was inquiring about the website.
D shared her story and has graciously allowed me to reprint it to help other readers avoid the same fate.
"I was using [scam website] as training to learn investing.
I made an investment of $250.00 US and a broker worked with me and showed me trades and of course as we traded the money initially invested grew.
We did a little investing with crypto through their platform.
I signed up for CoinBase and bought Bitcoin that we transferred over.
Altogether my investment was $4,750 Canadian.
I attempted to withdraw money from the [scam website] account to my CoinSmart account and I received an email saying that in order to get my funds I had to pay a liquidation fee of $4,900 CDN.
I didn’t have the $4,900 on the spot.
Our e-transfers are limited which in hindsight is a good thing.
It didn’t seem right, why did I have to pay a fee to withdraw funds? I spoke with CoinSmart and they told me that the email I received about the liquidation fee didn’t come from them." I advised D to not pay any kind of "liquidation fee" and to cut her losses at this point.
The "broker" is still contacting her - which is part of the scam.
Here's a breakdown of exactly how the scam works 1.
A broker contacts you, usually via social media, asking you sign up and deposit a small amount of money with them.
2.
These companies will access your computer via some kind of remote desktop software like AnyDesk and conduct "trades" on your account (while explaining what they're doing to make it seem legit).
These trades will always be profitable because they aren't real and instead use dummy software to replicate real trades.
3.
The company gets you to wire a larger amount of money to them (this can be in fiat currency, but more commonly now using crypto).
4.
More fake trades occur with the intention of getting you to wire them even more money.
5.
If you ever try to withdraw the money...
either the company ghosts you on the spot...
or they will start some BS about "withdrawal fees" or "liquidation fees" which are often more than your entire investment.
--- Now here’s how to avoid how this ever happening to you 1.
Only use well known brokerages (like CoinBase, Binance or Crypto.com).
If you aren't sure about a brokerage, look them up in their local jurisdiction.
All brokers (stocks, crypto, FOREX) are required to register with their local financial authority (like FINRA in the US or the FCA in the United Kingdom) and will have a unique license number which you can look up online.
For example, Coinbase has been licensed by FINRA and the SEC since 2010.
You can lookup US brokers at https://brokercheck.finra.org/ And in the UK you can go to https://register.fca.org.uk/ 2.
Never allow anyone to trade on your behalf - either via wiring money to them or by allowing them to access your computer via a remote desktop.
3.
If it smells like a scam, it probably is.
Cloud Mining Scams Cloud mining scams have been around since cryptocurrency first really started becoming popular in 2016.
The premise is similar to any Ponzi scheme.
Websites will ask you to deposit either fiat money or cryptocurrency to be part of a cryptocurrency mining group.
Usually they will promise huge gains of up to 1.5% PER DAY.
Many of these websites with display fake figures in an attempt to provide their legitimacy.
These include listed giant number of users or statistics claiming they have been in business for many years.
Other tell-tale signs of a scam are attempts to keep all communication on Telegram or WhatsApp as opposed to channels like email.
Figure 14: USDminer claims to have 36 million registered users, however the website was less than 1 month old at the time of writing The following active websites are confirmed to be scam mining operations Xminer Miner Plus Pageminer Nhash USDminer Muxminer Fake Bitcoin Lending Schemes Another common crypto scam is in the form of a "lending scheme", where you receive regular payouts for the cryptocurrencies that you have supposedly lent to the borrower.
We should note that there are legitimate cryptocurrency lending schemes via platforms like Celsius, Block-Fi or Crypto.com.
However there are also many outright scam platforms, some of which made off with tens of millions in investor money.
Here are the 2 most prominent ones.
Bitconnect This is one of the most famous crypto scams, and became so big that it even made the top 10 list of coins according to market cap.
They offered a kind of lending scheme where your currencies would be locked and you would receive a payout regularly.
Their project initially claimed they had an AI-enabled trading bot that guaranteed abnormal profits for all their holders.
The impossibly high payouts (1% daily compounding interest) combined with the multi-level marketing nature of the platform meant that the initial payouts were only funded by new money being deposited into the scheme, and not by the trading bot itself.
Davorcoin Similar to Bitconnect, Davorcoin was introduced as an ICO and had lending programs where the investors could receive a payout.
There was a presence of a pyramid-like affiliate program and fake promises of a crypto debit card which never saw the light of day.
CASE STUDY: SQUID GAME CRYPTO SCAM On September 17, 2021, a Korean show called Squid Game was released on Netflix.
The plotline centered around hundreds of cash-strapped people fighting simple games in a do-or-die situation to win a huge cash prize.
The show became an instant hit across the world and reached the #1 position within a matter of days.
Consequently, the Internet started flooding with Squid Game memes and posts.
When the whole world was obsessed with the show in October 2021, a group of developers released a Squid Game token (SQUID) which was listed on CoinMarketCap.
The coin was themed surrounding the popular show and started trading at $0.02 per token on October 26th.
By November, the price of the token had risen to $2,800, which meant an increase of 14,300,000% in a matter of weeks.
The phenomenal increase had something fishy about it.
You guessed it right, it was a classic example of a pump-and-dump scheme, but the public was yet to understand that.
Now let's deconstruct what happened and how the price rose by such high margins.
A group of developers who have conveniently stayed anonymous launched this crypto project called Squid Game.
This token would be used as an entry pass or "buy-in" to Squid Game-themed games like Red Light/Green Light and Honeycomb.
The winners of these games would be rewarded with cash prizes.
When they won a game, they would be rewarded with "marbles", another reference from the show.
The developers used an anti-dumping strategy, which implied that unless a player won a marble, they wouldn't be able to sell their tokens.
All of it sounds perfectly fine in theory until we come to the real catch of the situation.
The developers had yet to come up with a real game for this Squid Game project.
This meant that the players had no option to win the marbles because there was no game for them to play.
Until they won the marbles, there was no way to sell the tokens, which means they were trapped in a situation over which they had no control and there was nothing to be done.
The players thought they were waiting for the games to begin, but that never happened.
The craze surrounding the show skyrocketed the prices of the token, and eventually, the developers cashed out the coins and took away $12 million.
This is nothing but an outright fraud and the developers should immediately be put behind bars.
More than anything, this is a lesson for all crypto investors to not gamble on crypto created around the latest hype.
The hype will die down soon, and so will the price of the token.
The phenomenal rise is simply a trick to keep you interested and invested.
Just like there are penny stock frauds in the stock markets, there are bogus tokens and rug pulls in the crypto market.
Would you avoid the stock market because of those penny stocks? If not, then why should you avoid the crypto space because of these scams? The key to succeeding in any market is the same—go for the genuine stocks and tokens.
Pick the best cryptos, not something random like Squid Game.
11 11 CRYPTO PREDICTIONS FOR 2022 Every year in our daily newsletter (which you can join at https://freemanpublications.com/bonus) I like to make predictions for the coming financial year.
This year I thought I’d do something a little more permanent and print them in our book.
So here we go, my 11 crypto predictions for 2022.
A Q1 bear market will see Bitcoin drop below $40,000 before reaching $100,000 by the end of the year.
Another Bitcoin ETF will launch, except this one will track the spot price of Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin futures like BITO.
Ethereum will become the next Trillion Dollar coin (this would put the price of 1 ETH at around $7,300).
But they still won’t move to Proof of Stake until 2023.
Solana will reach a market cap of over $200 Billion by the end of the year.
Solana will also “decouple” from Bitcoin, meaning that its price will move independent of Bitcoin prices.
At least 1 major country will announce that some of its national debt has been collateralized using stablecoins.
A new government body will be created to regulate cryptoassets (and this will be a good thing in the long run).
A least 1 Fortune 500 company will allow full-time employees to be paid in cryptocurrency.
There will be at least 1 major fraud case in the NFT market.
NFT marketplace OpenSea will do traditional IPO, despite calls for the company to do an ICO on the crypto markets instead.
Blockchain gaming will provide a new onboarding into the crypto space, which will significantly increase the overall number of people owning cryptocurrency.
At least one meme coin with a $1 Billion market cap will completely collapse.
Feel free to email me your own predictions at admin@freemanpublications.com.
CONCLUSION: AMARA’S LAW AND PLAYING THE LONG GAME Roy Amara isn’t exactly a household name, except in Futurism circles.
The Stanford researcher who passed away in 2007, gave us one of the most poignant quotes about technology in the past 100 years, which has since been coined “Amara’s Law” “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run”.
This is no more true than in the crypto world.
Whenever you come across articles about cryptocurrencies, you will find two extremes being portrayed - either the article claims that cryptos are the ultimate savior of humankind or they will caution you because they are purely speculative and always bring you eternal doom.
The truth is that while cryptocurrency is new, within just a few years of their existence, it has managed to make its mark on us and the economy.
Like it or not, cryptocurrency is here to stay.
However, you must understand that this is not a linear journey to riches.
There is going to be continued volatility in this space for the next 5 years at least.
And you should fully expect any cryptocurrency you buy to decline by at least 50% at some point if you are planning to hold it for at least five years.
But if you can stomach those downturns, many of these millionaire maker assets will be the ones that allow you to retire early, put your kids through college, and create generational wealth for you and your loved ones.
To illustrate this, let’s take one final look at Bitcoin price fluctuations.
THE ROLLERCOASTER OF BITCOIN PRICES Since its inception, Bitcoin has been notorious for having the highest highs and coming down to the lowest lows within months.
Bitcoin first hit $1 in April 2011.
In July 2011, the value rose to $29.60, which means a 2,960% increase within three months.
After a sharp recession, the value came down to $2.05 by November.
After an uneventful 2012, Bitcoin rose rapidly in 2013 from $13.28 in the beginning to $230 in April and then fell drastically to $68.50 within a few weeks.
The year ended with an all-time high of $1,237.55, only to fall by almost 44% within the next three days.
Bitcoin struggled with its prices throughout 2014 and 2015 with no major highs or lows.
By the end of 2016, Bitcoin was priced at $900 and increased by 122% in the next six months.
However, the real high came in December 2017 when Bitcoin skyrocketed to $19,345.49.
This was the moment when it truly attracted the attention of the entire world and all spheres of the economy.
The next two years were again uneventful, and prices fell to around $6,000 by December 2019.
When the economy was shut down due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Bitcoin prices again showed bursts of activity after starting 2020 at $6,965.72.
The year ended for Bitcoin on the highest-ever note after increasing 416% from the beginning of the year and reaching $29,000 in December 2020.
Bitcoin had reached a bull run and kept smashing its records by reaching $40,000 in January 2021 and $63,000 in April 2021.
Prices started falling soon after, and the summer of 2021 saw a 50% decline.
However, Bitcoin again reached an all-time high of $67,549.14 in November 2021, only to fall by 22% within a month when the economy started having a scare about the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Since 2009, here are some of the volatility events Bitcoin has undergone: 10 drawdowns of over 30% 5 drawdowns of over 50% 3 drawdowns of over 80% 1 drawdown of over 90% The most important thing to take from this though, is that even with all these pullbacks, Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency space continues to move into new highs.
In 2021 alone we saw the value of the cryptocurrency industry go from $800 Billion to over $2.8 Trillion in just 10 months.
PLAY SMART As you can already see, drawdowns are an integral part of investing in crypto and you should not go for investing in this market if that bothers you.
Our suggestion is to dedicate 5-10% of your portfolio to cryptocurrency.
In this way, even if you lose everything, your maximum loss will be limited to only 10%.
If the bullish thesis is correct, then that 5% can be worth 50% of your portfolio or more.
This asymmetric bet will ensure a high upside and minimal downside.
Although in the short term most crypto prices still mirror Bitcoin prices, you can end up enjoying a greater gain percentage if you hold different types of currencies.
For instance, when prices of both Bitcoin and Ethereum are rising, the rate of increase in Ethereum might be greater than that of Bitcoin.
Even if the total value of your portfolio is huge, start small with crypto.
The amount invested should be something that you are comfortable losing.
No matter what everyone says, there is no rule that you have to invest in crypto to make money.
Some people simply don’t have the required risk appetite.
However, there is no doubt that crypto is the next big financial asset class, and the riskiest financial move you can make over the next decade is not owning any.
As we have explained through the course of this book, investing in crypto does not have to be very difficult.

Should you buy the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)? | Kiplinger.
Kiplinger.
https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/603621/proshares-bitcoin-strategy-etf-bito But cryptocurrencies are not backed by any public or private entities.
Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world.
It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have largely functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure.
The legal status of cryptocurrencies has implications for their use in daily transactions and trading.
In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.5 As of December 2021, El Salvador was the only country in the world to allow Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions.
In the rest of the world, cryptocurrency regulation varies by jurisdiction.
apan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property.6 Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are subject to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer.
China has banned cryptocurrency exchanges and mining within its borders.
India was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies in December.7 Cryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union.
Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies will need to qualify as "financial instruments." In June 2021, the European Commission released the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that sets safeguards for regulation and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies.8 Within the United States, the biggest and most sophisticated financial market in the world, crypto derivatives such as Bitcoin futures are available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities.
    Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as a financial asset or property.
And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains in selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits.
On May 20, 2021, the U.S.
Department of the Treasury announced a proposal that would require taxpayers to report any cryptocurrency transaction of and above $10,000 to the IRS.9 How exactly the IRS would tax proceeds—as capital gains or ordinary income—depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency.10  Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency  Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure.
As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved.
At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation.
 Some advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrencies are as follows.
 Advantages  •	Cryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money.
In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties.
Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure, such as a large bank, setting off a cascade of crises around the world, such as the one that was triggered in 2008 by the failure of institutions in the United States.
 •	Cryptocurrencies promise to make it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company.
Such decentralized transfers are secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, such as proof of work or proof of stake.11  •	Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties are faster as compared to standard money transfers.
Flash loans in decentralized finance are a good example of such decentralized transfers.
These loans, which are processed without backing collateral, can be executed within seconds and are used in trading.12  •	Cryptocurrency investments can generate profits.
Cryptocurrency markets have skyrocketed in value over the past decade, at one point reaching almost $2 trillion.
As of May 2022, Bitcoin was valued at more than $550 billion in crypto markets.13  •	The remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases.
Currently, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders.
Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders and, subsequently, converted to the destination fiat currency.
This method streamlines the money transfer process and makes it cheaper.
 Disadvantages  •	Though they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are actually pseudonymous.
They leave a digital trail that agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can decipher.
This opens up possibilities of governments or federal authorities tracking the financial transactions of ordinary citizens.14  •	Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases.
The case of Dread Pirate Roberts, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known.
Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.15  •	In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain.
In reality, ownership is highly concentrated.
For example, an MIT study found that just 11,000 investors held roughly 45% of Bitcoin's surging value.16  •	One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection.
However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume.
The expensive energy costs coupled with the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues running into the billions of dollars.
According to an MIT study, 10% of miners account for 90% of its mining capacity.16  •	Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, other crypto repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked.
Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in millions of dollars worth of "coins" stolen.17  •	Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility.
Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to as high as $17,738 in December 2017 before dropping to $7,575 in the following months.3 Some economists thus consider cryptocurrencies to be a short-lived fad or speculative bubble.
 $576 billion  Total market cap of Bitcoin, as of May 2022.
 How Do You Get Cryptocurrency?  Any investor can purchase cryptocurrency from popular crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, apps such as Cash App, or through brokers.
Another popular way to invest in cryptocurrencies is through financial derivatives, such as CME's Bitcoin futures, or through other instruments, such as Bitcoin trusts and Bitcoin ETFs.
 What Is the Point of Cryptocurrency?  Cryptocurrencies are a new paradigm for money.
Their promise is to streamline existing financial architecture to make it faster and cheaper.
Their technology and architecture decentralize existing monetary systems and make it possible for transacting parties to exchange value and money independently of intermediary institutions such as banks.
Can You Generate Cryptocurrency?  Cryptocurrencies are generated by mining.
For example, Bitcoin is generated using Bitcoin mining.
The process involves downloading software that contains a partial or full history of transactions that have occurred in its network.
Though anyone with a computer and an Internet connection can mine cryptocurrency, the energy- and resource-intensive nature of mining means that large firms dominate the industry.
What Are the Most Popular Cryptocurrencies?  Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency followed by other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, Solana, and Cardano.
Are Cryptocurrencies Securities?  The SEC has said that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, are not securities.
It has not commented on the status of other cryptocurrencies.
Investing in cryptocurrencies and other initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

The phone buzzed on the nightstand—once, twice, three times—waking Ankit Jain from what had been a restful sleep.
Before he could reach the phone, three more texts came through.
He knew who it would be: his boss, Thorsten Konig, the CEO of Ivory Tower, the world’s leading online education platform.
In Sun Valley talking crypto.
It’s time.
Payments + investment.
How fast can we do it?  Pls call ASAP to discuss.
Bring in Shira and Paul.
Ankit sighed.
Thorsten was a brilliant technologist who had started and sold DayTradz, one of the first online retail trading platforms, before he was even 30.
Ivory Tower was his second, also hugely successful, venture—one that was disrupting higher education by offering high-quality college and graduate-school courses to students around the world.
Some, such as the intro to economics class taught by a Nobel Prize winner donating his time, were extremely affordable, while others, such as classes on personal branding with Kris Jenner and on M&A with Carl Icahn, were obscenely expensive.
The idea was to have the platform’s wealthiest users subsidize its poorest.
The impact Ivory Tower had achieved in the five years since its launch—and in the 13 months since its IPO—was amazing.
But sometimes being the CFO of a fast-moving company led by a “crazy genius” was exhausting.
For months now Thorsten had been talking about integrating cryptocurrency into the business.
He was a huge proponent of Bitcoin1 and had put about 5% of his own portfolio into it.
Several weeks ago the CEO had asked Ankit to have his team look into accepting tuition payments and keeping some of Ivory Tower’s cash reserves in crypto.
In media interviews, Thorsten had also started alluding to “our crypto future,” sparking speculation that he would build or buy a crypto trading platform.2 But Ankit knew that Thorsten was committed to Ivory Tower for at least the next few years; he just wanted to combine it with his new passion.
To Thorsten, taking fees and making investments in Bitcoin were simple matters—akin to doing business in euros as well as dollars, which Ivory Tower already did.
Bitcoin adoption could allow the U.S.-based company to further hedge itself against dollar inflation.3  Ankit knew that things were much more complicated.
Although cryptocurrencies were gaining mainstream appeal, even established ones like Bitcoin were highly volatile, with value swings that made them look more like speculative stocks.
Sure, it was possible to take payment in Bitcoin and then convert it to dollars, but the company had to figure out whether it made sense to build the internal capability needed or to hire a third-party vendor to handle transactions.
And investing earnings in crypto was another thing entirely.
Ankit’s head hurt just thinking about the financial-reporting challenges.
Then there was his fiduciary responsibility as CFO: Did shareholders really want Ivory Tower to bet on crypto if doing so might risk the capital needed down the road for developing better technology and courses and expanding the company’s reach?  Unfortunately, Thorsten rarely took no for an answer.
So Ankit rolled out of bed and texted his teammates.
“Morning.
T asking about crypto again.
Zoom at 8 to discuss? He’ll join at 8:30.”  Within a minute, he’d received two thumbs up.
By now everyone was used to Thorsten’s impromptu meetings.
Ankit just hoped this one wouldn’t end with an edict.
Evaluating the Options  “I mean we can accept tuition payments in Bitcoin.” Paul Abebe, Ivory Tower’s controller, had jumped in immediately on the Zoom call.
Everyone had been working from home since the start of the pandemic, and the company had decided it wouldn’t require anyone to return to its Manhattan headquarters.
“It’s annoying—not as liquid as nondigital currencies, obviously.
There would be IRS reporting and anti-money-laundering compliance issues to consider.
But the question is: Why should we do it?”  “Thorsten says it fits with our ethos: embracing the future, spearheading new technologies, shaking up the stodgy educational community,” Shira Peretz, Ankit’s deputy, said.
“Edo loves the idea too.” She was referring to Edo Sanger, Ivory Tower’s CMO.
“He thinks it will make for great press.”  “And will that translate into more users and revenues?” Paul asked skeptically.
“What percentage of our students even care about this?”4  “Well, our blockchain and crypto courses are actually some of our most popular, but Thorsten admits that at this point most people probably won’t pay in Bitcoin,”5 Ankit said.
“He’s more interested in investing our excess cash in it.
Thoughts?”  “It’s a terrible idea,” Paul said.
“Agree,” Shira said.
“There’s no GAAP guidance on how to account for this stuff yet.6 But the AICPA says Bitcoin isn’t considered cash or a cash equivalent, inventory, or a financial instrument, so it needs to be treated like an intangible asset, which means that if its value falls, we have to mark it down on our balance sheet.
But if it goes up, we report those gains only when we sell.
So if we’re meaningfully invested, we could be taking big, random hits to our net income for no business-related reason.
Communicating the company’s performance will get more complicated.”  “But if Bitcoin goes up in the long run, could it give us gains that smooth out or boost profitability?” Ankit asked.
“Our shareholders aren’t looking for perfect quarterly results.
They want us to invest wisely to grow the company.”  “I’m sorry, but an asset that goes from a valuation of $60K to $30K in one month cannot be considered a prudent investment,” Paul countered.
“How do we know that Bitcoin will be worth as much next year as it is now? And will we use just Bitcoin or also Ether or any of the thousands of other cryptocurrencies?”  “For now, Thorsten’s talking only about Bitcoin,” Ankit said.
“It has the largest user base and longest history.
And he’s convinced it will go up in value.”  “If our shareholders want to bet on crypto, they can do it directly,” Paul said.
“When we filed our S-1 for the IPO, we didn’t say anything about a Bitcoin treasury.”  “Well, we’d disclose it, and investors could sell if they’re not on board,” Shira said.
Then she shook her head.
“But I agree that it’s too soon, too volatile.
I vote for accepting Bitcoin payments—if it’s doable without too much compliance and IT complications.
Investments, no.”  “I’m a no and a no,” Paul said.
 Just then, Ankit saw that Thorsten was in the Zoom waiting room.
“OK, guys, here comes T,” he said, letting the CEO in.
 “Hello, friends!” Thorsten said as his face popped up on-screen.
“What a fabulous day to be talking about the future.
Catch me up on our crypto plans.”  Ankit took the lead.
“We’ve evaluated our options, and while we appreciate the potential benefits of Bitcoin, we’re going to advise against—”  “Aha! I knew you guys would say this.
Your job is to worry about the spreadsheets.
I understand.
But that’s why I’m here: to help you see the big picture.
Bitcoin is the future.
There is no world in which it underperforms relative to major currencies over the next decade.7 We have so much cash in reserves.
Why wouldn’t we put some of it into assets that produce high returns we could invest in the company? We could get appreciation up to 10 times what we’d otherwise see.
We’ll help propel Bitcoin forward and democratize the movement of money, just as we’re democratizing education.
We must do this!”  Ankit could tell that Paul and Shira were deflated, if not surprised.
This did seem like a fait accompli.
What Thorsten wanted, Thorsten usually got.
 The Board’s Concerns  After setting his team to work figuring out how to take crypto payments and spending a few hours modeling various levels of investment in Bitcoin, Ankit checked his email.
Cindy Yu, the company’s newest director and the head of its audit committee, had sent a message asking him to call her.
 “Cindy, hi! I just saw your message.
What’s up?”  “Hi, Ankit.
Thanks for getting back to me.
I’m calling with some board concerns.
Can we speak off the record?”  “Of course.”  “Thorsten has mentioned to several directors that he’s interested in making Bitcoin a bigger part of Ivory Tower’s business.
At the same time, he’s personally—and not insignificantly—invested in Bitcoin.
Some of us are worried that this at least has the appearance of a conflict of interest.” 8  “I see.”  “More important, some of us have questions about the wisdom of taking our treasury into crypto.
Obviously, I expect that we’ll discuss this at the board meeting next week, but I wanted to give you a heads-up.
I suspect that Thorsten has asked you to present a plan to us.
However, we want your candid opinion.
He has his allies, of course.
But as nonexecutive directors, we have to make decisions in the company’s best interest, and we expect the finance team to make recommendations based on the same criteria.”  “Of course.”  “I know Thorsten is a force of nature and doesn’t make it easy to disagree with him.9 But if you do, the board needs to hear it, and you will have our support.”  Case Study Classroom Notes  Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009.
Users on its network can send Bitcoins to one another ...
 Pressure from the CEO  At 7, Ankit was out for a jog when his phone rang: Thorsten.
 “Ankit.
Hope I didn’t catch you at a bad time.
I wanted to reconnect on crypto.”  “Just on a run.
No problem.”  “Ah, keep running.
I can talk as you go,” Thorsten said.
“I want you to know that I understand your hesitancy.
And we can take it slow.
But I have a track record of knowing what’s next in business.
First DayTradz, now Ivory Tower—both big successes, though many didn’t believe they could be.
You can trust me again now.
Bitcoin has outperformed the dollar since its inception, is gaining popularity with our user base, and in my opinion will be more efficient and secure than regular currencies.
Other cutting-edge companies are already starting to jump in.
Now is the time for us to as well.
Our support will help the crypto movement.
We’ll take power from large institutions and put it into the hands of the people.
This fits perfectly with our mission.”  Ankit wasn’t sure how to reply, but Thorsten didn’t press any further.
“OK, continue your exercise, my friend.
And tomorrow we’ll run toward the future together!”  After the call, Ankit picked up his pace and tried unsuccessfully to zone out to his iPhone music.
Was Thorsten right? If monetary exchange was going to move toward crypto, Ivory Tower should certainly get ahead of the shift.
But what if governments clamped down on cryptocurrency? If Bitcoin lost all its value? The board members were right to ask hard questions.
And Ankit wasn’t at all sure how to answer them.
 The Experts Respond: Should Ankit back Thorsten’s Bitcoin plans or not?     Amrita Ahuja is the CFO of Square.
 Ankit should support the push into Bitcoin—as both an accepted form of payment and an investment on the balance sheet.
At Square we believe there’s a high probability that the internet will have its own native cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin is the strongest contender.
It’s the most secure and resilient, with a principled, decentralized, transparent, and consensus-based development model.
We foresee a future in which companies won’t have to navigate fiat currencies and local rules and regulations that create complexity and high costs for consumer transactions across borders.
Cost, time, and security inefficiencies will fall away, and companies that accept Bitcoin payments will be able to serve anyone in the world, including people who have historically been marginalized by financial systems or who distrust federal banks (as in Latin America and certain other regions).
This fits perfectly with Ivory Tower’s mission of bringing quality higher education to underserved communities globally, and the company should get ahead of the game.
 Thorsten’s also right that having Bitcoin on the balance sheet will demonstrate to customers, employees (present and future), shareholders, and onlookers that it has “skin in the game” and will help make a more inclusive internet currency a reality.
In addition, Bitcoin can provide attractive diversification and act as an inflation hedge.
 Square invested 5% of its cash and cash equivalents in Bitcoin.
We believe that the long-term opportunity is worth any near-term volatility and that our investment will enable us to learn and help improve the system while increasing trust in it.
To that end, Square has set up the Crypto Open Patent Alliance to increase access to cryptotechnology through a collaborative patent library; Square Crypto, an independent team solely focused on contributing to the Bitcoin open-source work; a $10 million Bitcoin clean-energy initiative to incentivize miners to use renewable sources; and a $5 million endowment to fund education about Bitcoin and promote its adoption.
Ivory Tower could similarly be at the leading edge of network development, building good relationships with regulators to enable consumer protection and address bad actors while also fostering innovation and figuring out how to master custody, insurance, exchange, accounting, payroll, tax reporting, and compliance.
 Ankit, of course, needs to address all the concerns that his team and Cindy Yu have raised.
But with Thorsten’s support and a clear strategy and execution plan, he can make the case that the company has the opportunity to be at the forefront of this rapidly emerging trend.
This is the time for him to truly lead as CFO.
    Roxi Wen is the CFO of Invitae.
 The case against Ivory Tower’s moving to accept and hold Bitcoin is far stronger than the one for it.
Ankit should oppose the plan—but only after having a frank conversation with Thorsten to outline the downsides and explore other ideas.
 Paul is right that cryptocurrency is too volatile to be of balance-sheet quality.
If Ivory Tower wants an inflation hedge, many alternatives—gold and real estate, for example—are less risky.
Moreover, managing Bitcoin transactions and custody will require the finance department to build entirely new capabilities, such as safe storage for Bitcoin keys, and it’s unclear that that would be a good use of staff time.
And the regulatory environment is extremely uncertain; difficult disclosure rules or divestment requirements could crop up at any time.
 I also find it hard to believe people will want to pay tuition in Bitcoin.
Most buyers of crypto want to hold it for capital appreciation and as an inflation hedge, just like Thorsten.
Why would customers use their holdings to pay for courses, logging taxable capital gains now?  Thorsten thinks Bitcoin will be more secure and efficient than currencies backed by governments.
But that’s debatable, since fiat payments, particularly in developed countries, move securely and often more rapidly than Bitcoin blocks do.
 Sure, Bitcoin may someday trade as frequently and easily as dollars, euros, and yen.
Ivory Tower might get useful marketing value from being ahead of the curve and solidifying its reputation as a forward-looking innovator.
However, given the complexities surrounding Bitcoin, I think there are more-effective ways to gain competitive advantage.
 Ankit needs to artfully manage Thorsten.
When you work with a smart, fast-moving leader who is full of ideas, you often feel your job is to constantly say no.
But that’s not a productive relationship.
Instead, you want to have candid strategic conversations.
 The two men should talk about what Thorsten really wants.
Is it to embrace Bitcoin? Or to become part of the blockchain revolution? And if it’s the latter, is there another way to deploy the technology in the business? For example, could it be used to set up an open, distributed operating system where users could create their own classes? Could payment collection happen via blockchain even when customers pay in traditional currencies? These are much broader questions, and Thorsten’s answers might help Ankit find a way to honor the CEO’s wishes without doing exactly as he says.
 At my company my colleagues have lots of ideas about what to do with our significant cash reserves, but no matter how wild their suggestions are, I never just reject them.
I sit down with people, ask what they’re trying to accomplish, and brainstorm how to achieve those goals even if it’s in ways different from what they’ve suggested.
Ankit should do the same with Thorsten.
 Of course, the CEO could put his foot down and persuade the board to back him.
Elon Musk was able to do that with Bitcoin investments at Tesla.
But even then, Ankit could pitch a lower-risk experiment—perhaps creating a small, separate holding company to test Bitcoin in.
 The CFO has authority and credibility with Thorsten and the board.
He shouldn’t be afraid to use it.

We’re here to clear things up.
 Until fairly recently, if you lived anywhere other than San Francisco, it was possible to go days or even weeks without hearing about cryptocurrency.
 Now, suddenly, it’s inescapable.
Look one way, and there are Matt Damon and Larry David doing ads for crypto start-ups.
Swivel your head — oh, hey, it’s the mayors of Miami and New York City, arguing over who loves Bitcoin more.
Two N.B.A.
arenas are now named after crypto companies, and it seems as if every corporate marketing team in America has jumped on the NFT — or nonfungible token — bandwagon.
(Can I interest you in one of Pepsi’s new “Mic Drop” genesis NFTs? Or maybe something from Applebee’s “Metaverse Meals” NFT collection, inspired by the restaurant chain’s “iconic” menu items?)  Crypto! For years, it seemed like the kind of fleeting tech trend most people could safely ignore, like hoverboards or Google Glass.
But its power, both economic and cultural, has become too big to overlook.
Twenty percent of American adults, and 36 percent of millennials, own cryptocurrency, according to a recent Morning Consult survey.
Coinbase, the crypto trading app, has landed on top of the App Store’s top charts at least twice in the past year.
Today, the crypto market is valued at around $1.75 trillion — roughly the size of Google.
And in Silicon Valley, engineers and executives are bolting from cushy jobs in droves to join the crypto gold rush.
 As it’s gone mainstream, crypto has inspired an unusually polarized discourse.
Its biggest fans think it’s saving the world, while its biggest skeptics are convinced it’s all a scam — an environment-killing speculative bubble orchestrated by grifters and sold to greedy dupes, which will probably crash the economy when it bursts.
 I’ve been writing about crypto for nearly a decade, a period in which my own views have whipsawed between extreme skepticism and cautious optimism.
These days, I usually describe myself as a crypto moderate, although I admit that may be a cop-out.
 I agree with the skeptics that much of the crypto market consists of overvalued, overhyped and possibly fraudulent assets, and I am unmoved by the most utopian sentiments shared by pro-crypto zealots (such as the claim by Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter chief, that Bitcoin will usher in world peace).
 But as I’ve experimented more with crypto — including accidentally selling an NFT for more than $500,000 in a charity auction last year — I’ve come to accept that it isn’t all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built.
I’ve also learned, in my career as a tech journalist, that when so much money, energy and talent flows toward a new thing, it’s generally a good idea to pay attention, regardless of your views on the thing itself.
 My strongest-held belief about crypto, though, is that it is terribly explained.
 Recently, I spent several months reading everything I could about crypto.
But I found that most beginner’s guides took the form of boring podcasts, thinly researched YouTube videos and blog posts written by hopelessly biased investors.
Many anti-crypto takes, on the other hand, were undercut by inaccuracies and outdated arguments, such as the assertion that crypto is good for criminals, notwithstanding the growing evidence that crypto’s traceable ledgers make it a poor fit for illicit activity.
 What I couldn’t find was a sober, dispassionate explanation of what crypto actually is — how it works, who it’s for, what’s at stake, where the battle lines are drawn — along with answers to some of the most common questions it raises.
 This guide — a mega-F.A.Q., really — is an attempt to fix that.
In it, I’ll explain the basic concepts as clearly as I can, doing my best to answer the questions a curious but open-minded skeptic might pose.
 Crypto boosters will likely quibble with my explanations, while dug-in opponents may find them too generous.
That’s OK.
My goal is not to convince you that crypto is good or bad, that it should be outlawed or celebrated, or that investing in it will make you rich or bankrupt you.
It is simply to demystify things a bit.
And if you want to go deeper, each section has a list of reading suggestions at the end.
 CRYPTO WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE  Understanding crypto now — especially if you’re naturally skeptical — is important for a few reasons.
 The first is that crypto wealth and ideology is going to be a transformative force in our society in the coming years.
 You’ve heard about the overnight Dogecoin millionaires and Lamborghini-driving Bitcoin bros.
But that’s not the half of it.
The crypto boom has generated vast new fortunes at a clip we’ve never seen before — the closest comparison is probably the discovery of oil in the Middle East — and has turned its biggest winners into some of the richest people in the world, essentially overnight.
Some riches could vanish if the market crashes, but enough has already been cashed out to ensure that crypto’s influence will linger for decades.
 Crypto’s madcap, meme-crazed online culture can make it seem frivolous and shallow.
It’s not.
Cryptocurrencies, even the jokey ones, are part of a robust, well-funded ideological movement that has serious implications for our political and economic future.
Bitcoin, which emerged out of the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, first caught on among libertarians and anti-establishment activists who saw it as the cornerstone of a new, incorruptible monetary system.
Since then, other crypto realms have fashioned similarly lofty goals, like building a decentralized, largely unregulated version of Wall Street on the blockchain.
 We are already starting to see a swell of crypto money headed toward the U.S.
political system.
Crypto entrepreneurs are donating millions of dollars to candidates and causes, and lobbying firms have fanned out across the country to win support for pro-crypto legislation.
In the coming years, crypto moguls will bankroll the campaigns of crypto-friendly candidates, or run for office themselves.
Some will peddle influence in the familiar ways — forming super PACs, funding think tanks, etc.
— while others will try to escape partisan gridlock altogether.
(Crypto millionaires are already buying up land in the South Pacific to build their own blockchain utopias.)  Crypto is poised to soon become one of a handful of true wedge issues, with politicians all over the world forced to pick a side.
Some countries, like El Salvador — whose crypto-loving president, Nayib Bukele, recently announced the development of a “Bitcoin City” at the base of a volcano — will go full crypto.
Other governments may decide that crypto is a threat to their sovereignty and crack down, as China did when it outlawed cryptocurrency trading last year.
The divide between the world’s pro-crypto and no-crypto zones could end up being at least as big as the divide between the Chinese internet and the American one, and maybe even more consequential.
 In America, we have already seen how crypto can scramble the usual partisan allegiances.
Former President Donald J.
Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, are united in crypto skepticism, for example, while Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, is in the same bullish camp as Senator Ron Wyden, the Democrat from Oregon.
We have also seen what can happen when the crypto community feels politically threatened, as happened last summer, when crypto groups rallied to oppose a crypto-related provision in President Biden’s infrastructure bill.
 What I’m saying, I guess, is that despite the goofy veneer, crypto is not just another weird internet phenomenon.
It’s an organized technological movement, armed with powerful tools and hordes of wealthy true believers, whose goal is nothing less than a total economic and political revolution.
 CRYPTO COULD BE DESTRUCTIVE  The second reason to pay attention to crypto is that understanding it now is the best way to ensure it doesn’t become a destructive force later.
 In the early 2010s, the most common knock on social media apps like Facebook and Twitter was that they just wouldn’t work as businesses.
Pundits predicted that users would eventually tire of their friends’ vacation photos, that advertisers would flee and that the whole social media industry would collapse.
The theory wasn’t so much that social media was dangerous or bad; just that it was boring and corny, a hype-driven fad that would disappear as quickly as it had arrived.
 What nobody was asking back then — at least not loudly — were questions like: What if social media is actually insanely successful? What kind of regulations would need to exist in a world where Facebook and Twitter were the dominant communication platforms? How should tech companies with billions of users weigh the trade-offs between free speech and safety? What product features could prevent online hate and misinformation from cascading into offline violence?  By the middle of the decade, when it was clear that these were urgent questions, it was too late.
The platform mechanics and ad-based business models were already baked in, and skeptics — who might have steered these apps in a better direction, if they’d taken them more seriously from the start — were stuck trying to contain the damage.
 Are we making the same mistake with crypto today? It’s possible.
No one knows yet whether crypto will or won’t “work,” in the grandest sense.
(Anyone who claims they do is selling something.) But there is real money and energy in it, and many tech veterans I’ve spoken to tell me that today’s crypto scene feels, to them, like 2010 all over again — with tech disrupting money this time, instead of media.
 If they’re wrong, they’re wrong.
But if they’re right — even partly — the best time to start paying attention is now, before the paths are set and the problems are intractable.
 The third reason to study up on crypto is that it can be genuinely fun to learn about.
 Sure, a lot of it is dumb, shady or self-refuting.
But if you can look past the carnival barkers and parse the convoluted jargon, you’ll find a bottomless well of weird, interesting and thought-provoking projects.
The crypto agenda is so huge and multidisciplinary — drawing together elements of economics, engineering, philosophy, law, art, energy policy and more — that it offers lots of footholds for beginners.
Want to discuss the influence of Austrian economics in Bitcoin development? There’s probably a Discord server for that.
Want to join a DAO that invests in NFTs, or play a video game that pays you in crypto tokens for winning? Dive right in.
 CRYPTO IS A GENERATIONAL SKELETON KEY  Mind you, I am not suggesting that the crypto world is diverse, in the demographic sense.
Surveys have suggested that high-earning white men make up a large share of crypto owners, and libertarians with dog-eared copies of “Atlas Shrugged” are likely overrepresented among crypto millionaires.
But it’s not an intellectual monolith.
There are right-wing Bitcoin maximalists who believe that crypto will liberate them from government tyranny; left-wing Ethereum fans who want to overthrow the big banks; and speculators with no ideological attachments who just want to turn a profit and get out.
These communities fight with one another constantly, and many have wildly different ideas about what crypto should be.
It makes for fascinating study, especially with a bit of emotional distance.
 And if you do learn some crypto basics, you might find that a whole world opens up to you.
You’ll understand why Jimmy Fallon and Steph Curry are changing their Twitter avatars to cartoon apes, and why Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, spent a decent chunk of last year tweeting about a digital currency named after a dog.
Strange words and phrases you encounter on the internet — rug pulls, flippenings, “gm” — will become familiar, and eventually, headlines like “NFT Collector Sells People’s Fursonas for $100K In Right-Click Mindset War” won’t make you wonder if you’re losing your grip on reality.
 Crypto can also be a kind of generational skeleton key — maybe the single fastest way to freshen your cultural awareness and decipher the beliefs and actions of today’s young people.
And just as knowing a little about New Age mysticism and psychedelics would help someone trying to make sense of youth culture in the 1960s, knowing some crypto basics can help someone perplexed by emerging attitudes about money and power feel more grounded.
 Again, I don’t really care whether you emerge from these explainers as a true believer, a devoted skeptic or something in between.
Participate or abstain as you wish! All I’m after is understanding — and possibly, a little relief from the question that has consumed my social and professional life for the past several years:  “So … can I ask you a question about crypto?”  Let’s start from the beginning: What is crypto?  A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography.
But in recent years, it’s been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies.
These days, “crypto” usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains — the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.
 Ah yes, blockchains.
Can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?  At a very basic level, blockchains are shared databases that store and verify information in a cryptographically secure way.
 You can think of a blockchain like a Google spreadsheet, except that instead of being hosted on Google’s servers, blockchains are maintained by a network of computers all over the world.
These computers (sometimes called miners or validators) are responsible for storing their own copies of the database, adding and verifying new entries, and securing the database against hackers.
 So blockchains are … fancy Google spreadsheets?  Sort of! But there are at least three important conceptual differences.
 First, a blockchain is decentralized.
It doesn’t need a company like Google overseeing it.
All of that work is done by the computers on the network, using what’s called a consensus mechanism — basically, a complicated algorithm that allows them to agree on what’s in a database without the need for a neutral referee.
This makes blockchains more secure than traditional record-keeping systems, proponents believe, since no single person or company can take down the blockchain or alter its contents, and anyone trying to hack or change the records in the ledger would need to break into many computers simultaneously.
 The second major feature of blockchains is that they’re typically public and open source, meaning that unlike a Google spreadsheet, anyone can inspect a public blockchain’s code or see a record of any transaction.
(There are private blockchains, but they’re less important than the public ones.)  Third, blockchains are typically append-only and permanent, meaning that unlike with a Google spreadsheet, data that’s added to a blockchain typically can’t be deleted or changed after the fact.
 Got it.
So blockchains are public, permanent databases that nobody owns?  You’re getting it!  Now remind me: How are blockchains related to cryptocurrencies?  Blockchains didn’t really exist until 2009, when a pseudonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto released the technical documentation for Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.
 Bitcoin used a blockchain to keep track of transactions.
That was notable because, for the first time, it allowed people to send and receive money over the internet without needing to involve a central authority, such as a bank or an app like PayPal or Venmo.
 Many blockchains still perform cryptocurrency transactions, and there are now roughly 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, according to CoinMarketCap.
But many blockchains can be used to store other kinds of information, too — including NFTs, bits of self-executing code known as smart contracts and full-fledged apps — without the need for a central authority.
 OK, but can we back up a second? Weren’t tech people telling us, years ago, that crypto was a new and exciting form of money? And yet, nobody I know pays their rent or buys groceries in Bitcoin.
So were those people just … wrong?  Good question.
It’s true that today, hardly anyone pays for things in cryptocurrency.
In part, that’s because most merchants still don’t accept crypto payments, and hefty transaction fees can make it impractical to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency on daily living expenses.
It’s also because the value of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether has historically gone up, making it somewhat risky to use them for offline purchases.
(The counterexamples are usually cited with pity, like the guy who, in 2010, bought two Papa John’s pizzas using Bitcoin that was worth about $40 at the time, but would be worth roughly $400 million today.)  It’s also true that the value of cryptocurrencies has grown enormously since the early Bitcoin days, despite them not being most people’s daily spending money.
 Part of that growth is speculation — people buying crypto assets in hopes of selling them for more later on.
Part of it is because the blockchains that have emerged since Bitcoin, like Ethereum and Solana, have expanded what can be done with this technology.
 And some crypto fans believe that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will eventually stabilize, which could make them more useful as a means of payment.
 What are the actual uses of crypto, beyond financial speculation?  Right now, many of the successful applications for crypto technology are in finance or finance-adjacent fields.
For example, people are using crypto to send cross-border remittances to family members abroad and Wall Street banks using blockchains to settle foreign transactions.
 The crypto boom has also led to an explosion of experiments outside of financial services.
There are crypto social clubs, crypto video games, crypto restaurants and even crypto-powered wireless networks.
 These non-financial uses are still fairly limited.
But crypto fans often make the case that the technology is still young, and that it took the internet decades to mature into what it is today.
Investors are pouring billions of dollars into crypto start-ups because they think that someday, blockchains will be used for all kinds of things: storing medical records, tracking streaming music rights, even hosting new social media platforms.
And the crypto ecosystem is attracting tons of developers — an auspicious sign for any new technology.
 I’ve heard people calling crypto a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme.
What do they mean?  Some critics believe that cryptocurrency markets are fundamentally fraudulent, either because early investors get rich at the expense of late investors (a pyramid scheme), or because crypto projects lure in unsuspecting investors with promises of safe returns, then collapse once new money stops coming in (a Ponzi scheme).
 There are certainly plenty of examples of pyramid and Ponzi schemes within crypto.
They include OneCoin, a fraudulent crypto operation that stole $4 billion from investors from 2014 to 2019; and Virgil Sigma Fund, a $90 million crypto hedge fund run by a 24-year-old investor who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.
 But these cases aren’t usually what critics are talking about.
They’re generally arguing that crypto itself is an exploitative scheme, with no real-world value.
 And are they right?  Well, let’s try to understand the case they’re making.
 Unlike buying stock in, say, Apple, a purchase that (theoretically, at least) reflects a belief that Apple’s underlying business is healthy, buying a cryptocurrency is more like betting on the success of an idea, they say.
If people believe in Bitcoin, they buy, and Bitcoin prices go up.
If people stop believing in Bitcoin, they sell, and Bitcoin prices go down.
 Crypto owners, then, have a rational incentive to convince other people to buy.
And if you don’t think that cryptocurrency technology is inherently valuable, you might conclude that the entire thing resembles a pyramid scheme, in which you primarily make money by recruiting others to join.
 I’m sensing a “but” coming on.
 But! Even though there are scams and frauds within crypto, and crypto investors are certainly fond of trying to recruit other people to buy in, many investors will tell you that they are going in with their eyes wide open.
 They believe that crypto technology is inherently valuable, and that the ability to store information and value on a decentralized blockchain will be attractive to all kinds of people and businesses in the future.
They would tell you they’re betting on crypto the product, not crypto the idea — which, on some level, isn’t all that different from buying Apple stock because you think the next iPhone is going to be popular.
 Matt Huang, a prominent investor, spoke for many crypto fans when he said on Twitter: “Crypto may look like a speculative casino from the outside.
But that distracts many from the deeper truth: the casino is a trojan horse with a new financial system hidden inside.”  You can argue with that position, or dispute how much this “new financial system” is actually worth.
But crypto investors clearly believe it’s worth something.
 Is crypto regulated?  Only slightly.
In the United States, certain centralized crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, are required to register as money transmitters and follow laws like the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires them to collect certain information about their customers.
Some countries have passed more stringent regulations, and others, like China, have banned cryptocurrency trading entirely.
 But compared with the traditional financial system, crypto is very lightly regulated.
There are few rules governing crypto assets like “stablecoins” — coins whose value is pegged to government-backed currencies — or even clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service about how certain crypto investments should be taxed.
And certain areas of crypto, like DeFi (decentralized finance), are almost completely unregulated.
 Partly, that’s because it’s still early, and making new rules takes time.
But it’s also a property of blockchain technology itself, much of which was designed to be hard for governments to control.
 This question comes from the (apparently crypto-curious) rapper Cardi B: Is crypto going to replace the dollar?  Sorry, Cardi.
The dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and dislodging it would be a huge, costly project that isn’t likely to happen any time soon.
(To give just one small example of the enormity of the task: every financial contract that is denominated in dollars would have to be re-denominated in Bitcoin or Ether or some other cryptocurrency.)  There are also technical hurdles crypto needs to overcome if it’s ever going to displace government-issued currency.
Today, the most popular blockchains — Bitcoin and Ethereum — are slow and inefficient compared with traditional payment networks.
(The Ethereum blockchain, for example, can process only about 15 transactions per second, whereas Visa says it can process thousands of credit card transactions per second.)  And, of course, for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin to replace the dollar, you’d need to convince billions of people to use a currency whose value fluctuates wildly, that isn’t backed by a government and that often can’t be retrieved if it’s stolen.
 What kind of people are investing in crypto? Is it all — to quote a recent “Curb Your Enthusiasm” episode — “nerds and Nazis”?  It’s hard to say who’s investing in crypto, especially since a lot of activity takes place anonymously or under pseudonyms.
But some surveys and studies have suggested that crypto is still dominated by affluent white men.
 Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange, estimated in a recent report that women made up only 26 percent of crypto investors.
The average crypto owner, the group found, was a 38-year-old man making approximately $111,000 a year.
 But crypto ownership does appear to be diversifying.
A 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that Asian, Black and Latino adults were more likely to have used crypto than white adults.
Crypto adoption is also growing outside the United States, and some studies have suggested that crypto adoption is growing fastest in countries like Vietnam, India and Pakistan.
 My colleague, Tressie McMillan Cottom, has made the case that crypto — because it relies on permanent, irrefutable records of ownership of digital goods and currencies — is particularly attractive to people from marginalized groups, who may have had their property unjustly taken from them in the past.
 “If I live in a community where the police absolutely use eminent domain to claim my private property and I cannot do anything about it,” she wrote, “that sense of everyday powerlessness would make the promise of blockchain sound pretty good.”  That said, some recent studies have also found that a small number of people own the vast majority of crypto wealth — so it’s not necessarily an egalitarian paradise.
 And what about extremists? Are they into crypto?  Some are.
Because you can buy and sell cryptocurrency without using your name or having a bank account, crypto in its early days was a natural fit for people who had reasons to avoid the traditional financial system.
They included criminals, tax evaders and people buying and selling illicit goods.
They also included political dissidents and extremists, some of whom had been kicked off more mainstream payment services like PayPal and Patreon.
 As a result of their well-timed entry into the crypto market, some extremists have gotten rich.
A recent investigation by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that several prominent white supremacists have made hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars by investing in crypto.
 Of course, there are millions of crypto owners, the vast majority of whom are not white supremacists.
And the same properties of anonymity and censorship-resistance that make crypto useful to white supremacists might also make it attractive to, say, Afghan citizens fleeing the Taliban.
So labeling the entire crypto movement an extremist group would be overkill.
Regardless, it’s safe to say that crypto has become attractive to all kinds of people who would rather not deal (or can’t legally deal) with a traditional bank.
 Another criticism I’ve heard is that crypto is bad for the environment.
Is that true?  This is a real can of worms — and one of the most frequent objections to crypto.
 Let’s start with what we know for sure.
It’s true that most crypto activity today takes place on blockchains that require large amounts of energy to store and verify transactions.
These networks use a “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism — a process that has been compared to a global guessing game, played by computers all competing to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to add new information to the database and earn a reward in return.
Solving these puzzles requires powerful computers, which in turn use lots of energy.
 The Bitcoin blockchain, for example, uses an estimated 200 terawatt-hours of energy per year, according to Digiconomist, a website that tracks crypto energy usage.
That’s comparable to the annual energy consumption of Thailand.
And Bitcoin’s associated carbon emissions have been estimated at roughly 100 megatons per year, which is comparable to the carbon footprint of the Czech Republic.
 Holy moly! How do crypto fans justify that kind of environmental impact?  Crypto advocates often quibble with these statistics.
They also argue that:  • Our existing financial system also uses a lot of energy, between powering millions of bank branches, A.T.M.s that sit idle for most of the day, gold mines and other energy-intensive infrastructure.
 • Many crypto-mining computers are already powered by renewable energy sources, or by energy that would otherwise be wasted.
 • Most newer blockchains are built using consensus mechanisms that require much less energy than proof-of-work.
(Ethereum, for example, is scheduled to switch to a new type of consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake sometime in 2022, which could reduce its energy usage by as much as 99.5 percent.)  And are those arguments valid?  Partly.
It’s true that most newer blockchains are designed in a way that requires considerably less energy than Bitcoin, and that Ethereum’s switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism will greatly shrink its environmental footprint, if and when it happens.
 But it’s also a bit convenient to steer attention away from Bitcoin, which is still the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.
Bitcoin’s energy needs aren’t expected to fall significantly anytime soon.
And even if every Bitcoin miner ran entirely on renewable energy — which, to be clear, isn’t the case — there would still be an environmental cost associated with maintaining the blockchain.
 All told, it’s clear that crypto as we know it today has a significant environmental impact, but it’s hard to measure exactly how significant.
Many frequently cited statistics come from industry groups, and it’s hard to find trustworthy, independent data and analysis.
 But few crypto fans would dispute that blockchains consume substantially more energy than a traditional, centralized database would — just as 100 refrigerators use more energy than one refrigerator.
They just argue that crypto’s environmental impact will shrink over time, and that the benefits of decentralization are worth the costs.
 Got it.
And those benefits, again, are …  Some crypto proponents will tell you that the biggest benefit of decentralization is the ability to create currencies, apps and virtual economies that are resistant to censorship and top-down control.
(Imagine a version of Facebook, they’ll say, in which Mark Zuckerberg couldn’t unilaterally decide to kick people off.)  Others will say that the biggest perk of decentralization is that it allows artists and creators to control their own economic destinies more directly by giving them a way (in the form of NFTs and other crypto assets) to bypass platform gatekeepers like YouTube and Spotify, and sell unique digital works directly to their fans.
 Still others will say that crypto is most useful to people who don’t live in countries with stable currencies, or to dissident groups living under authoritarian regimes.
 There are a million other hypothetical benefits of decentralization and crypto, some of which are realistic and some of which probably aren’t.
 How do you actually use crypto? Is it like sending a payment over Paypal or Venmo?  It can be.
The quickest way to get started using cryptocurrencies is to set up an account with a crypto exchange like Coinbase, which can link to your bank account and convert your U.S.
dollars (or other government-issued currency) into cryptocurrency.
 But many crypto users prefer setting up their own “wallets” — secure places to store the cryptographic keys that unlock their digital assets.
 Once you’ve got some crypto in your wallet, the process can be pretty simple — just type in the recipient’s crypto wallet address, pay a transaction fee (if applicable), and wait for the payment to clear.
 Other types of crypto transactions, like buying and selling NFTs, can be significantly more complicated, but the basic act of sending a payment to someone typically takes only a few minutes.
 I’m ready to dive into the rest of your explainers.
But first, I have one final question about crypto’s culture: Why is it so weird and insular?  This is maybe the question I get asked most about crypto.
People see their friends, co-workers and relatives diving down the crypto rabbit hole and emerging days or weeks later with a new obsession, new internet friends, a bunch of new jargon and the seeming inability to talk about anything else.
(There’s even a word for this — getting “cryptopilled.”) People who believe in crypto tend to really believe in it — to the point that they can appear to the outside world more like evangelists for a new religion than fans of a new technology.
 I was a religion reporter once, and I don’t think the comparison is totally inapt.
(It’s also not necessarily a bad thing: Plenty of people find meaning and community and intellectual stimulation in religion.) As people like the Bloomberg journalist Joe Weisenthal have pointed out, crypto has similar elements to an emerging religion: an enigmatic founder (the still-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto), sacred texts (the Bitcoin white paper) and rituals and rites to mark yourself as a believer, such as tweeting “gm” (crypto speak for “good morning”) to your fellow believers, or photoshopping laser eyes onto your profile picture.
 It’s fun to laugh at the (often cringeworthy) ways crypto fans try to entertain and inspire each other.
But focusing too much on their behavior and customs might mean missing what’s genuinely novel — and, depending on where you sit, either exciting or dangerous — about the technology itself.
Which is why, when my friends ask me how to talk to their cryptopilled relatives, I advise them to start by trying to understand what’s gotten them so excited in the first place.
                             Go deeper:  “WTF Is the Blockchain?” In this basic explainer of blockchain technology, Mohit Mamoria looks into how blockchains work and the problems they’re intended to solve.

     HODL.
DApp.
Ethereum.
 No, these are not words from a newly-discovered alien language.
They’re among the many new and key terms in the language of cryptocurrency.
 Cryptocurrency isn’t just a novel investment option, and in many ways represents a different world altogether compared to traditional stocks and bonds.
Between unfamiliar acronyms, emerging technologies, and keeping up with memes and tweets, just learning the basics takes time, even for seasoned traditional investors.
 As with any investment, it’s important to understand exactly what you’re investing in before you start.
That’s especially true when it comes to a speculative — and still evolving — asset like crypto.
  There are a few prerequisites we recommend before you buy into crypto, like stocking your emergency fund, paying down high-interest debts, and securing a traditional retirement plan.
And, like we’ve said before, you should only ever put into crypto what you’re willing to lose, and experts recommend dedicating no more than 5% of your portfolio to these digital assets.
  But another item you should add to your checklist is at least a beginner’s understanding of what you’re getting into, including how crypto differs from other investment strategies, and the different factors that can affect a cryptocurrency’s market value.
 Here are some of the terms and phrases that will help beginners better understand the world of crypto investing.
  RELATED: Top Crypto News This Week  Crypto Terms You Should Know  Altcoin  An altcoin is any coin that’s not Bitcoin.
Altcoins can be anything from the second-most popular coin, Ethereum, to any of the thousands of coins with very minimal market value.

 Blockchain  A digital form of record keeping, and the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies.
A blockchain is the result of sequential blocks that build upon one another, creating a permanent and unchangeable ledger of transactions (or other data).
 Coin  A representative store of digital value that lives on a given blockchain or cryptocurrency network.
Some blockchains have the same name for both the network and the coin, like Bitcoin.
Others can have different names for each, like the Stellar blockchain, which has a native coin called Lumen.
Coinbase  A popular centralized cryptocurrency exchange.
Coinbase made history recently as the first cryptocurrency exchange to go public on the Nasdaq.
Cold Wallet/Cold Storage  A secure method of storing your cryptocurrency completely offline.
Many cold wallets (also called hardware wallets) are physical devices that look similar to a USB drive.
This kind of wallet can help protect your crypto from hacking and theft, though it also comes with its own risks – like losing it, along with your crypto.

Bitcoin is commonly referred to as digital gold.
Ethereum  The second largest cryptocurrency by trade volume, Ethereum is a crypto network and software platform that developers can use to create new applications, and has an associated currency called ether.
Exchange  A cryptocurrency exchange is a digital marketplace where you can buy and sell cryptocurrency.
Fork  When a blockchain’s users make changes to its rules.
These changes to the protocol of a blockchain often result in two new paths — one that follows the old rules, and a new blockchain that splits off from the previous one.
(Example: a fork of Bitcoin resulted in Bitcoin Cash).
Gas  A fee that developers have to pay to the Ethereum network in order to use the system.
Gas is paid in ether, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum.
Genesis Block  The first block of a cryptocurrency ever mined.
HODL  Stands for “Hold On for Dear Life” though the term originated from a user typo on a Bitcoin forum in 2013.
It refers to a passive investment strategy in which people buy and hold onto cryptocurrency — instead of trading it — in the hopes that it increases in value.

Hash  A unique string of numbers and letters that identify blocks and are tied to crypto buyers and sellers.
Hot Wallet  A software-based cryptocurrency wallet connected to the Internet.
While more convenient for quickly accessing your crypto, these wallets are a bit more susceptible to hacking and cybersecurity attacks than offline wallets — just as files you store in the cloud may be more easily hacked than those locked in a safe in your home.
Initial Coin Offering (ICO)  A way that funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency project.
ICOs are similar to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) of stocks.
Market Capitalization  Cryptocurrency market capitalization refers to the total value of all the coins that have been mined.

TRY copytrading Although the word cryptocurrency is often thrown around as a blanket statement to describe any token operating on the Blockchain, in reality, there are several subdivisions.
Understanding the differences between these crypto-assets can help you take your trading to the next level, it opens you up to the deeper world of crypto, allowing you to earn interest on your investments, play Blockchain games, and send transactions for pennies.
Have a look at the graphic below, after reading it you’ll understand the different types of crypto and how you can use them to your advantage.
what are cryptoassets what is the blockchain On the surface Blockchain technology seems impossible to understand, with any definition typically accompanied by a load of jargon.
However, if we take a step back and look at Blockchain technology in simple terms, it becomes far easier to grasp.
The Blockchain is a database that gets distributed to every computer on the network, instead of connecting to a central server.
This is advantageous because it makes the Blockchain near-impossible to take down.
The database contains the data from every transaction that takes place on a network, every time a new transaction occurs it gets added to the database.
These lists of transactions are separated into manageable “blocks”, which each contain a transaction timestamp and a link to the previous block.
Because each block has to be validated by every computer on the network, it makes it impossible to falsify a transaction, resulting in a tamper-proof ledger containing every transaction to ever take place.

Why is Bitcoin So Volatile? Up 15% today, down 10% tomorrow.
Bitcoin volatility is one of the scariest things a cryptocurrency trader can experience.
Bitcoin volatility 👉What causes the price of Bitcoin to fluctuate? Well, a lot of it has to do with the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin's future.
As a new technology, Bitcoin is yet to prove itself, the problems it aims to solve are big and there’s not a whole lot of real-world data to say definitively if Bitcoin can solve them.
👉 Because nobody can predict the future of BItcoin, investors get easily swayed.
a negative news story releases and people think Bitcoin is dead, a billionaire tweets his support and the price shoots sky-high.
👉 Should you be concerned about Bitcoin’s fluctuations? Although it’s true volatility can be scary, when used correctly it allows you to take your trading game to the next level.
Is the volatility of Bitcoin good or bad for trading? While it’s true Bitcoin is becoming more and more accepted as a form of currency, the market is still fiercely volatile.
Of course, this isn’t ideal for Bitcoins use case as a store of value (although as you can see from the graphic above, the price is only increasing) but for traders, a bit of volatility can be the perfect storm.
Picture for a second two traders - one trades cryptocurrency and the other Forex.
The person trading cryptocurrency is subject to extreme volatility but because of this doesn't need to have much capital and doesn’t need to use leverage.
On the other hand, because prices only change by a fraction of a penny, the person trading Forex needs to use far greater leverage or requires a huge amount of capital.
While neither person is wrong, the person trading cryptocurrency has the potential to see a far greater return on investment.
Is Bitcoin doomed to be volatile forever? At the end of the day, cryptocurrency is still young.
Until a ceiling is found volatility is par for the course, as such you should attempt to embrace volatility rather than fight against it.
It’s impossible to say when Bitcoin will stabilise, but until that happens we recommend taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, so why would a new global standard currency? Only time will tell where Bitcoin ends up but the longer it’s actively used and the more decentralised it becomes, the more likely it is that it will find its footing.
Until that happens we recommend you take advantage of this volatility and use it to accumulate wealth.
how to read crypto charts #2 LINE CHART A line chart is the simplest and most basic type of stock chart used to analyze crypto market.
A line chart shows the direction of the cryptocurrency closing price.
This quickly gives the crypto-chart reader a view of the price trend.
Identifying trends, whether they are moving up, down or across and also knowing when they are about to reverse is really key to your Crypto trading.
No matter what asset you are trading, you need to know how to follow charts.
#1 BAR CHART A bar chart helps you to identify the prevailing trend and to time the entry and exit of your trades.
#2 CANDLESTICK CHART Candlestick charts are used by traders to determine possible price movement based on past patterns.
Candlesticks are useful when trading as they show four price points (open, close, high, and low) throughout the period of time the trader specifies.
what is a bull or bear market A bull market describes the constant rising of a crypto market.
Per definition,the market generally increases by at least 20%.
A bear market describes the constant falling of a crypto market.
Per definition, the market generally decreases by at least 20%.
When you open a BUY POSITION, you are said to be BULLISH.
When you open a SELL POSITION, you are said to be BEARISH.
BULLISH CANDLE BEARISH CANDLE BULLISH TREND BEARISH TREND how to read a candlestick chart One of the most important things you need to learn before delving deeper into the world of cryptocurrency trading is how to read a candlestick chart.
When compared to a line chart or something similar, a candlestick chart provides you with a much clearer insight into how the market is performing, making it a key tool in any trader's arsenal.
If you take a look at the image below, we can see it highlights the differences between a bearish and bullish candle and shows you how to successfully interpret candlestick movements.

Plus500CY LTD authorised & regulated by CYSEC (#250/14) What moves crypto market? There’s a lot of volatility in the cryptocurrency market, however, it’s rarely without reason.
Once you begin to understand what causes these wild swings, you’re well on your way to becoming an expert trader! To help you better understand some of the contributing factors, we’ve broken the main ones below.
#1 Supply and demand Supply and demand has a huge influence on the price of pretty much everything in the modern world, cryptocurrency is no exception to this rule.
📰 The vast majority of cryptocurrencies have a finite supply, meaning ifsomething were to drive up demand, the price will shortly follow.
It can be hard to notice an uptick in demand, but you can make it far easier by following media coverage.
🐶 Take, for example, Dogecoin, a small project that was essentially a joke, but somehow ended up making investors millions! You might be asking yourself “how’s that even possible? Well, when Elon Musk tweeted about Dogecoin, showing he believed in it, investors could only come to one logical conclusion - if the richest man in the world thinks it’s a good investment, I should probably invest too.
☝Following this, there was a huge increase in demand for Dogecoin, causing the price to rise, generating further publicity, resulting in a snowball effect.
#2 Bad Press 📺 Because cryptocurrency is still in its infancy, any bad press can have a catastrophic effect on price.
Unfortunately, once negative news has been released it’s usually too late to take action, instead, we recommend taking a “buy the rumor, sell the news” approach.
💸 By doing this, you can capitalize on both negative and positive news, alowing you to make money no matter the condition of the market! * A great example of this is China banning cryptocurrency.
The average peson may look at this headline and start panicking, but by following this strategy you would’ve primed yourself to make thousands! Instead of selling out of fear, you would’ve heard about this news and started researching, by doing so you would see this isn’t the first time China has “banned” cryptocurrency.
🛒 With this knowledge in hand, you could’ve strategically sold your positions and bought back in for far cheaper, generating huge profits as the price starts to stabilize.
#3 Integration 👱As a relatively new technology, many people are looking at cryptocurrencywith wide eyes, wondering what it will end up amounting to.
This depends massively on something called institutional adoption, which involves large companies like Amazon integrating crypto technology into their platforms.
🚀In a similar way to Musk and Dogecoin, this shows that a large company, with deep pockets, believes in cryptocurrency, often causing an upward trend in price.
🤳In July earlier this year (2021), there was a rumor circulating about Amazon starting to accept crypto payments, as you could imagine, this sent social media into a frenzy.
As this story began to do the rounds, it caused wild speculation about the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, with many believing other companies, were soon to follow.
☝Although this story was later confirmed to be false by Amazon, the price of Bitcoin shot up drastically rising from $34,400 to over $40,000, an increase of over 15%.
#4 Key Events ⚠Cryptocurrency is an emerging financial market with the unprecedented potential to put wealth back in the hands of the people.
As such, any issues with regulations or security can send shockwaves throughout the entire industry - at the end of the day, nobody wants to see their hard-earned investment disappear due to something like a security issue.
💣Because of this just the rumor of regulatory issues, or a security exploit,can be devastating for the market as a whole.
In June 2016, Etheruem released a new feature and was beginning to gain traction, however, an exploit was found and an Ethereum DAO’s funds (essentially a decentralized corporation) started getting drained at a rate of $8 million an hour, all the way to the tune of $55 million.
📉Not a bad day for the hacker I’m sure, but for Ethereum it was devastating, many began to lose trust in the network and almost 50% was whipped off the price instantly.
Crypto Trading strategies Do you want to trade like a pro? Then you’re going to need to learn about a few sure-fire trading strategies.
Following a trading strategy helps to minimize risk and maximize profits! Find one that works for you and stick to it! #1 Day Trading 💸 Do you want to make a full-time living from cryptocurrency? Then daytrading might be the strategy for you! You can use this method to make huge profits by taking advantage of small price changes.
Simply, buy a coin and sell it once it’s risen or fallen by a small amount, a quick turnover time massively reduces risk.
Seems simple right? 📌 Well, as you might have guessed without a large pile of cash to invest, you wouldn’t make much money if Bitcoin, for example, rose by a couple of hundred dollars.
Here’s where leverage comes in handy, it allows you to magnify your profits up to 100x.
This means you still make hundreds if not thousands from tiny increases and decreases in price.
However, it’s crucial to only trade using leverage once you have experience because it also amplifies your losses.
#2 Trend Trading 📈 Trend trading takes advantage of swings in the market, by watching the charts you can identify upward or downward trends.
You should note, it’s almost impossible to buy right at the bottom or to sell at the peak, this is because before a movement in price begins, there is nothing for you to base your trade on.
🙋 It can be rather hard to find which cryptos will start rising or falling, but not for our readers! We’ll clue you into this expert strategy for identifying trends in the market.
Just have a look at the top gainers and losers and try to find out if you’re at the start, middle, or end of a trend.
As long as the trend isn’t about to end, you can make some money! ⚠As the saying goes, with risk comes reward.
But understandably, not everyone is comfortable risking large sums of money, this is where a strategy like hedging can be beneficial.
Instead of putting all of your eggs in one basket, spread them out, this negates a lot of the risk involved with trading.
⚒This approach does require a bit more work than the other strategies we’ve mentioned because you need to analyze how likely it would be for the price to rise and fall and set up trades accordingly.
💪For example, if you think a trade has a high chance of going your way, bet more on the positive outcome and reduce your position on the negative.
If you think it’s likely your trade will go south, do the opposite.
#3 Hedging Strategy #4 HODL Strategy 👉Probably the simplest strategy we’ve spoken about, and oftentimes themost profitable, HODLing (holding), involves buying and simply waiting for a coin to rise.
While this might seem like a no-brainer, there is a bit more to it than just buying a cryptocurrency and praying.
💸Firstly, you should always try and buy during a dip, this ensures you won’t get caught out and end up having to wait months for a coin to rise back up in value.
Secondly, this method isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme, you need to have faith in the long-term potential of the project; make sure it has solid technology and a good team behind it.
HOW elon musk moves crypto 🤳Elon Musk has been a big proponent of cryptocurrency for a while now.
While the huge amount of publicity he generates for crypto is excellent and benefits the market as a whole, his actions have previously spelled disaster for investors.
Earlier this year in May, after a month of praising cryptocurrency Musk released a tweet stating Tesla would no longer be accepting Bitcoin, this sent shockwaves through the crypto space.
💣The price of Bitcoin crashed sending the market into a frenzy, investors rushed to sell their crypto before prices fell anymore.
This created a snowball effect, people were selling, driving prices down, which in turn, resulted in even more people selling.
Ultimately, Musk tweeted that Tesla would begin accepting Bitcoin again and prices started to stabilize.
Although it’s easy to get caught up in the news, oftentimes it pays to stick to your guns instead of getting caught up in the opinions of others.
Cycle of Crypto Trader Emotions 👉 In cryptocurrency, managing your emotions well can be the difference between making thousands and losing everything.
Every trader goes through a cycle of emotions, when everything is green and the market is in your favour you’ll become elated and euphoric, when it begins to drop anxiety and fear start to take hold, culminating and intensifying as the price continues to fall until you reach the and find anger and despair.
👉 Where along this cycle would you sell? You might be thinking “just as anxiety and fear take hold”, after all, this would shield you from any large losses.
In reality, that’s already far too late, it’s better to sell at peak happiness, right when your investments are hitting all-time highs.
👉 A period of extreme growth is almost always followed by a dip, which would allow you to buy back in, increasing your position size.
Once you master your emotions you can trade without bias, putting you on the path to becoming a professional trader.

APPENDIXBitcoin White Paper – a Must Read for allHistory of Money56ForewordI am not going to print this bookThe changes that are happening on an almost day to daybasis means that if I print it, parts of the book will beredundant within a few monthsCryptocurrencies and the Blockchain will change the waywe see the world.It cuts out middlemen, fees and timewasters.And at the same time, fortunes will be made.Not just by the owners of the companies, but by thoseindividuals who are brave enough to get involved at thisearly stage in investing in Cryptocurrencies, ICOs andcompanies set to benefit from blockchain technology.This book was written for you, the beginner, in mind.I hope it helps.The best is yet to come.To your successMarcus de Maria71.
Introduction“Science-Fiction is now Science-fact”- UnknownAt the end of 2016 I read that some cryptocurrencies had gone up by 5000% injust 12 months.
I decided to do some research, fast.
This is what I found: $100worth of Bitcoins bought in 2010 would be worth well over $27 million today.How could I have missed out on those returns? It was time to get in.A few weeks of research later and I had bought 15 different cryptocurrenciesusing speculation money.
Most of the coins quickly went into profit, somesubstantially.
I decided I needed to take this more seriously and really do someresearch.
If not me then who? If not now then when? You have to be in thegame to win it!I paid several thousand dollars for the best crypto subscription service I couldfind, and started buying more and more cryptos based on theirrecommendations.
I got obsessed – I was even listening to it while goingrunning.
At the time of writing, I now own more than 36 different cryptos andover 50+ positions, have banked some profits and am still up over 70% on myentire investments.
Not a bad start.8As you can see, I invested $73,000 and made a profit of $64,000 which is an88% gain.
This happened in as little as just 3 months.
This was definitely helpedby a fast growing Altcoin called NEO.
I invested just $850 and turned that into$26,300 profit! I am not sure where else you can do that at the current timebut it is possible with cryptocurrencies.So what are cryptocurrencies and where did it all start?1.
A decentralised system for sending money to other peopleMost payment systems run on a centralised network.
The problem with this isthat you have to incur unnecessary and expensive transaction fees.
Usually,this is done by a central server that keeps track of your balances i.e.
your creditcard and/or the banks.
It can also take several days for one bank to talk toanother bank and so sending money becomes both expensive and takes toolong.A programmer calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto successfully found a way tobuild a decentralised digital cash system, thus avoiding the need for acentralised system.
He describes it in a surprisingly simple way in his WhitePaper for Bitcoin, which I have added in the Appendix.
You should read itbefore buying Bitcoin.9A decentralised system means the network is powered by its users withouthaving any third party, central authority or middleman controlling it.
Neithercentral banks or Governments has power over this system.2.
What are cryptocurrencies?Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies which can be used to digitally transfermoney to another person safely, without having to use intermediaries ortrusted third parties, like a bank or Visa, e.g., to verify that you have sent themoney and the money is now no longer yours.
You might want to read thatsentence again, slowly.
In addition, it does it much faster at a fraction of thecost because it does away with unnecessary and expensive transaction fees.Why 'crypto'?The way digital currencies provide safety is two-fold.
The first is that it usesEncryption technology (hence the name cryptocurrency).What is the blockchain?10The second way is to have a public ledger, where all the transactions are kept.Thousands of computers around the world are linked together to display thisledger.
They refresh and update every few minutes.
This network of computersall linked together in this way is called the blockchain.
You can trust it becauseit means that each transaction has been verified again and again by all thecomputers (the blockchain).
With thousands of computers linked up all overthe world saying the same thing, the ledger’s integrity is upheld.
Eachcryptocurrency can have its own blockchain, although some are shared.How does this work?Imagine I send you 10 dollars and you send the 10 dollars to someone else.Somehow someone has to keep track of these transactions, to avoid forgeriesor anyone claiming they haven’t received the money.
In the past, Central Banksor banks have kept details of the transaction on something called a ledger.
Thisis based on a centralised system.
With Bitcoin, currently the main digitalcurrency, the whole system was turned on its head.
Instead of a centralisedsystem controlling the ledger, now thousands of computers, all around theworld, each keep a copy of this Ledger.
Every single transaction is kept there,from the beginning to present day.
This is a decentralised system, called the‘blockchain’.Please note that money in itself does not have any intrinsic value – it is onlybecause we believe that it has value that it is worth anything.
Money is just atracking system – we track what we own and what we owe.
This is called aledger.
Whatever form of money exists, we give it value because of its utility asa ledger (or tracking system of who owes what).
That’s what the blockchain is –a giant decentralised ledger.Why are so many computers necessary?11The idea comes from airplane safety.
If you have one computer flying the planeand the system crashes, the airplane could crash.
The thought was that if therewere three computers, and one crashed, then the fact that two computerswere saying something different to one meant that the two outweighed theone and the plane would continue even if one crashed.
The inventors of theblockchain took it one step further and wanted as many computers as possibleto be in on it.
So if there is a disagreement on a few computers of theblockchain, whatever the majority e.g.
51% are saying will win and thatinformation is put on the ledger on all the computers.A particularly brilliant analogy for this comes from Nick Szabo, the inventor ofBitgold, which many view as the precursor of Bitcoin.
Imagine a fly trapped inamber.
If there is only a small layer of amber, we know that the fly has notbeen trapped for very long.
But if there is a big block of amber, we know thatthe fly has been trapped for a long time – no one can dispute that.The blockchain computers are forming a layer of amber every time atransaction occurs.
Once the amber covers the transaction, it is very difficult tochange.
Each layer of amber on top makes it more difficult to change.
Each daymore information and more amber are layered on top.12In other words, millions of small transactions, i.e.
me sending you some moneyin another country, are documented on the blockchain, locking them in forgood, so that they can’t be changed afterwards.
The information (or fly) istrapped as irrefutable evidence and the transaction can’t be undone.
That'sthe whole point of the decentralised system – the computers allow it to remaindecentralised and in the hands of many as opposed to the hands of a few whoare trying to control the many.What are miners?There are two ways of getting Bitcoin.
You can either buy one at the currentprice (today’s price is $4,200 for one Bitcoin) or you can ‘mine’ it.
The analogyis like mining for Gold.
However, with digital currencies it is slightly different,as you don’t have to go down a mine to do so.
With cryptocurrencies, you haveto do it through something called, ‘Proof of Work’.
Proof of Work refers to thefact that if you want a Bitcoin, you have to literally prove that you have donework and in return you get paid in Bitcoin tokens.In cryptocurrencies this is done by creating a scenario where if you want to getpaid in Bitcoins, you have to do something which is not easy to do i.e.
you haveto commit your computers to solving puzzles or mathematical functions.
If thecomputer solves the puzzle then it proves that you have dedicated power,time, effort, heat and computation to solve the problem.
The more you do thisthe more of a ‘vote’ you are allowed to have.
This vote is embodied in a Bitcointoken.
You receive a token of Bitcoin (a fraction of a Bitcoin) in return formining it.Only miners are able to confirm a transaction.
This is their role in thecryptocurrency network.
They record transactions, verify them and dispersethe transactional information in the network.For every completed transaction monitored and facilitated by the miners, theyare rewarded with a token of cryptocurrency, for instance with Bitcoins.13What this does is introduce scarcity into the system.
Scarcity is importantbecause the only way anything has any value is because it is scarce.
If Gold, likepebbles, were to be found everywhere, it wouldn’t have any value.
ButBitcoins are not easy to mine – it takes computational power and time to do itAND there are a maximum of 21 million that can ever be mined.
This createsinstant scarcity.TermsAn Altcoin (Alternative coins) is the name given to coins which were set up tocompete with Bitcoin, like Dash, Litecoin and even Dogecoin.
The term‘crypto’, short for cryptocurrency, is used for all coins.A digital currency is a virtual currency.
It is unregulated, issued and usuallycontrolled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of aspecific virtual community.
It is a medium of exchange that operates like acurrency in that specific environment but not necessarily outside of it.A cryptocurrency is a currency based on certain principles of cryptography.
It isa type of digital token that relies on these principles to chain together digitalsignatures of token transfers.
It is based on a peer-to-peer network and it isdecentralised.In most situations, cryptocurrency is also a digital currency, though, in evenmore cases, digital currency is not a cryptocurrency.Summary:Bitcoin is a software program that allows people to securely transfer moneyover the internet without a bank.It does this by replacing the function of a bank with a network of computersrunning the software that verifies and transfers the money.These computers, known as miners, maintain a global ledger of transactionsthat is used to validate, verify and transfer money.142.
What are the benefits ofCryptos and whatproblem do they solve?The new digital revolution of money.Cryptocurrency has many appealing benefits.
Some of this is thanks to theblockchain technology previously mentioned.
It is a strictly monitored processwith encrypted transaction and control.A quick history of moneySince the beginning of human time, people have used something scarce as asource of value.
At the start they used bartering one object for another.
Buthow can you buy a cow if you only have two chickens? A third entity wasneeded, so they used the scarcest of seashells.
Then came coins made ofprecious metals.
At the beginning, coins did not have a value stamped onthem, rather the coins were weighed.
Only later was an actual value stampedonto the coin.Next was paper money backed by precious metal e.g.
Gold.
The idea was thatyou could literally walk into a bank and ask for the equivalent of your banknotes in Gold.
Then paper was taken off the Gold Standard and was not backedby anything, allowing the printing of money to flourish.
This is the current ‘fiat’money.15The problem is that fiat money is not scarce.
More money can be printed andso every year it is worth less and less.
The only store of value that retains itsvalue is Gold.
But Gold is not easy to store, not easy to sub-divide and not easyto transport.For a full breakdown of the timeline of the History of Money, see Appendices.Scarcity is an essential part of cryptos.
Take the largest, Bitcoin for example.
Asalready stated, only 21 million will ever be made, so scarcity is part of thesystem.1.
No Third-Party InvolvementThere’s always a process you go through when using traditional money to buyyourself a new property, set up your own business or buy a new car etc.
Oneway or another, the process requires a third-party involvement.
We are talkinglawyers, owners and some other external factors such as delays,documentation, extra fees etc.
This in general will consume unnecessary time,money and energy to the point of giving up in some cases.Recently, I wanted to send some money over to the USA.
In order to do that, Ihad to pick up the phone to my bank.
I was stuck in a queue listening to musicfor over eight minutes just to start the process.
I was then charged for sendingthe money plus an extortionate Foreign Exchange rate which did not resemblethe real rate.
Finally, since the transaction was via something called anintermediary bank, I was told that they would likely charge me as well,although they could not tell me how much.
The money, I was told, would bethere within 3-5 working days.
Since it was a large amount of money the wholething probably cost me over $200 if you include the Foreign Exchange spread,maybe more.
I agreed to everything because, well, I didn’t have manyalternatives.With cryptos, I can send Bitcoins directly to the other person from mycomputer to theirs online, within 10 minutes.
There is no spread, no ForeignExchange (Forex) charge, intermediaries etc.
And the whole thing might costme $10 maximum.So if you want to save a lot of time and money then cryptos are the way to go.16In short, you are in control of your own money using cryptocurrency.
This iswhat we call the ‘decentralised’ system.
It is possible to be able to pay andreceive money anywhere in the world at any given time.
Your transactions arepractically immune to any influence from your Government, with minimumprocessing fees, thus preventing users from having to pay extra charges frombanks or any financial institutions.Now imagine this in EVERY part of society – from legal contracts between twocompanies to sending money across the world; from keeping money in escrowwhen buying a house to online payments.
Basically, anywhere where there iscurrently a ’middleman’ who is either 1.
Slowing it down, or 2.
Making it moreexpensive.2.
Lower risk than traditional currenciesIn this era, most people rarely have their cash in their possession now.
Instead,they have an array of credit cards, debit cards and other payment cardsavailable as their nation’s method of payment.
Nothing’s wrong with that,however if the store’s connection to the server is disconnected or theirmachine is out of service, and you do not possess any cash, you cannot pay.When using your card, you are giving the end-receiver access to your full-creditline.
No matter how small the amount of the transaction is, the fact that youare giving someone your card to gain access to your account is already a formof ‘breach’.
Most of this ‘breach’ is considered secure nowadays using differingsafety measures like ‘PIN enabled’ or other methods.
Then the store initiatespayment by ‘pulling’ the designated amount from your account using theinformation provided within your card.Cryptocurrency doesn’t work that way.
Instead of a ‘pulling’ mechanism, it‘pushes’ the amount that is needed to be paid or received to othercryptocurrency holders without any further information needed.
Payments arepossible without your personal information being tied to you or thetransaction.
Your account can be backed up and encrypted to ensure the safetyof your money.By allowing users to be in control of their transactions helps keep Bitcoin, Etheror other larger cryptocurrencies safe for the network.173.
Protection from fraudWe often hear of cases where someone’s payment card is being used by otherusers but not the owner.
When contacting his card’s service issuer, it is foundthat the card has made certain transactions without his consent.
This is whatwe call a fraud case.Most of the time the perpetrators of these fraud cases get away with the crimebecause it is not easy to trace the fraud back to the perpetrator.
What’s moreit is even difficult to get the attention of law enforcers to launch aninvestigation.However, cryptocurrency is not viable to be used for fraud.
Due to the fact thatyour personal information is kept hidden from prying eyes, this protects youagainst identity theft.Remember, cryptocurrency is a form of digital money, created from code.Individual cryptocurrencies are, as mentioned, digital and cannot becounterfeited by senders.Because the transactions cannot be reversed, they do not carry with them anypersonal information.
This ensures security and the merchants are protectedfrom any potential losses that might occur from fraud cases.It is very hard to cheat using these cryptocurrencies due to its decentralisedsystem and the existing blockchain system.
It cannot be manipulated byanyone or any organisation thanks to it being cryptographically secure.
All thecomputers have a copy of all the transactions and the computers arecontinuously talking to each other.
This is the most secure way of doing it as noone can hack in and make changes.If someone wanted to hack into the blockchain they would be wasting theirtime hacking into just one or a few computers, since the information on themajority of computers always wins.
So in order to hack in they would have tohack 51% of the computers around the world that make up the blockchain tomake a change.
The computational power required to do this is prohibitive.18Also it would take some time.
The blockchain updates or refreshes its dataevery few minutes, giving a would-be hacker a few minutes window to hack inbefore everything is reset.
After that they would have to start again.
So notonly would they have to hack into 51% of the thousands of computers aroundthe world that make up the blockchain, but they would also have just a fewminutes window to do it in.4.
UniversalityOver the course of payment history, nations worldwide had their differingmethods of payments.
We had bartering or money-goods exchange systems.
Itwasn't until traders visited other countries that they found out how to tradeitems with one another.Thanks to various innovations and developments, we now have multiplemethods to trade and exchange moneys worldwide.But even with all the upgrades, we are still experiencing problems doingtransactions across the globe.
There are always currency issues, bankauthorisations, unacceptable payment methods and some other varying issuesexperienced by business owners or travellers abroad.Fact is, not all countries have similar financial procedures.
Your card orcurrency may not be accepted by other countries and that is a major setbackfor some people.
For example, most online banking, payment or cash systemrequires additional processing fees for their service.However, cryptocurrencies are not bound by any of the exchange rates,transaction charges, the interest rates or any other fees applied by anycountries.
They can be used at any time, in any part of the world, withoutexperiencing any problems.It also saves a lot of your time and money by reducing additional spending overtransferring money from and to multiple countries.
Which meanscryptocurrency operates on an international platform which in turn maketransactions easier than your average bank to bank transfer.Cryptocurrencies have three important properties:1.
Transactional Property19Cryptocurrency transaction is fast and global.
Transactions are propagatedimmediately in the network and are confirmed within minutes.
Since thetransactions are managed by a global network of computers, they do not takeinto account your physical location.
It is possible for you to send yourcryptocurrency to someone in your vicinity, or even if they are living on theother side of the world.2.
Monetary PropertiesSome people want to use Gold as a monetary value.
However, it is not easy tostore, it is not easy to subdivide and it is not easy to send.
Because it is heavy,sending it would also be costly.
Cryptocurrencies can be seen as digital goldbecause they are easy to store, easy to subdivide, easy to send & transport andless costly.The currencies are in controlled supply; thus there is a high chance that thevalue of the currencies appreciates over time.
As mentioned earlier, Bitcoinwill somehow reach its final number somewhere in 2140.3.
Revolutionary PropertyYou have more control of what is going on in your account and how the systemworks and operates.
This is due to the decentralised network of peers whichkeeps a consensus on account balances and the transactions made.
Ascompared to your physical bank account, which can be changed and controlledby people you don’t see and governed by rules you don’t even know (howmany of us really read the small-print?).20I attended the 2017 World Blockchain Conference in London.
Look, to prove it Ihave a picture of me in the audience.
Can you see me in the red circle? :--)Two things became clear.
Firstly, there is big excitement aboutCryptocurrencies and this excitement is growing rapidly.
The organisers toldme that last year there were only 30 people at the conference.
This year therewere well over 300 as far as I could see.Secondly, whether believed in cryptocurrencies or not, everyone believed thatblockchain would transform the world.Even people like Jamie Dimon, Head of JP Morgan, who is a fierce critic ofBitcoin, is heavily investing in the blockchain, because of the many applicationsof the blockchain and the potential it has to disrupt most industries, includinghis own.21One strategy I am therefore pursuing is to find current public companies in thestock market which are set to gain from the use of blockchain technology.Some of them are established companies and some of them are fairly new, butyou can buy them on the stock market now.223.
Why is it important forYOU?"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood."– Marie CurieLike most things tech, the realm of cryptocurrency can be a bit complex tomaster and is still new to many.
But the benefits of purchasing this currencyare surely worth your investment in both time and money.
Experts have alsopredicted that it may be the next big thing in finance.1.
Crypto Trading and InvestingBitcoin trading can be very profitable for both professionals and beginners.
Themarket is new, where arbitrage and margin trading is widely available.
Thecurrency’s high volatility has also played a major role in bringing new investorsto the trading market.Compared to other financial currencies, Bitcoin has very little barrier to entry.If you already own Bitcoin, no verification is required and you can start tradingalmost instantly.
Moreover, Bitcoin is not fiat currency.
This simply means theprice is not related to the economy or policies of any single country.And unlike stock markets, there are no official Bitcoin exchanges.
Instead,hundreds of Bitcoin exchanges operate 24/7 around the world.
Because thereare no official exchanges, this results in no official Bitcoin price andthecurrency is known for its rapid and frequent price movements.2.
Personal SpendingSecondly is personal spending.
There are millions of items now being sold forBitcoins and this number is only increasing.
You can use Bitcoin to purchasealmost anything! From buying cars (Tesla) to travelling the world (Cheapair).From buying a Microsoft product to paying Estate Agents.233.
HUGE potentialWe could well be in the midst of the next Gold Rush.
If that is the case, do youreally want to miss out?For me personally, I wouldn't want to be the one who said "I knew it was goingto be big, but I was too lazy to do anything about it and yet again I missed outwhile everyone else made a fortune" AND "What if everything I have learnedso far has led me up until this point." I even had the thought “What if I becomethe Warren Buffett of cryptocurrencies? Someone has to – why not me?" LOL.4.
Don't need a lot of moneyYou don’t need a lot of money to make really sizeable profits – even a fewhundred could turn into tens of thousands.Have you heard of Erik Finman? The teenage Bitcoin millionaire who startedpicking up Bitcoin at only $12 a piece back in May 2011, when he was just 12years old.
He received the Bitcoin as a tip from his brother and a $1000 giftfrom his grandmother.He now reportedly owns 403 Bitcoins, which holds a value of roughly $4000where it has accumulated to a stash of just over $1.6 million and change.I personally bought £850 worth of Antshares (now called NEO) and turned thatinto over £40,000 in three months.
Where else can you get 4000% return inthree months?5.
VolatilityYou might have thought that Forex was volatile.
You haven't seen anything yet.There are days when the portfolio is down by -15% and the next up by 15%.Individual coins can fluctuate by 50% in one week.
One of my coins went upover 100% in just one day.
In stocks, this kind of volatility would take an entireyear!Volatility is our friend – most people are scared of it because they feel theycan’t control it, but it is great.
How else can we buy low and sell high? An ideais to wait for the coin to go down and start buying into it in order to lower ouraverage price.244.
We are just at the startThe majority of people haven't heard of cryptocurrencies and even less aboutthe blockchain, meaning the value will increase as they become mainstream.254.
What are the maincryptocurrencies and what dothey do?There are around 1000 coins/Altcoins.
Some are legitimate and some may notbe.
It is imperative that you do your own research before investingWhich ones are the best ones?This changes all the time – do your research.
We will go more in depth into thisin the Chapter “How do you make money in cryptocurrencies?”Below are the largest coins at time of writing in terms of their marketcapitalisation (price in dollars x number of shares in the market).
They are in noparticular order:a.
BitcoinWhat problem does it solve?The first blockchain, solving the problem of duplication and manipulation.
It'slike Liquid Gold.This is the first ever cryptocurrency invented and remains by far the mostsought after cryptocurrency to date.
Bitcoin is known as the digital goldstandard in the cryptocurrency network.
As explained, Bitcoin is the pioneer ofblockchain technology that made digital money possible.It is the first ever decentralised peer-to-peer network powered by its userswithout any central authority or middleman which means no unnecessarycosts are included in the digital money transaction.26One major advantage that it has over other cryptocurrencies is Bitcoins areimpossible to counterfeit or inflate.
The reason being there are only 21 millionBitcoins created for mining, no more no less.
Therefore it is predicted by 2140,all Bitcoins will already be mined.Thanks to its blockchain technology, you have ultimate control over yourmoney and transactions without having to go through a third party such as thebank or PayPal.Interesting fact: WikiLeaks would not be here if it weren't for Bitcoin.
Whencredit card companies stopped their service to WikiLeaks, people used Bitcointo keep the service alive.Media companies and investment firms in South Korea, India, Australia,Canada and Japan have started discussing on how Bitcoin may surpass thevalue of certain fiat currencies in the future as an alternative monetary system.Japan even made it an official currency in April 2017, paving the way for othercountries to do the same.Over the years of Bitcoin’s existence, its value has fluctuated tremendouslyfrom zero to over $4200 per Bitcoin to date.Have I invested in Bitcoin?I buy Bitcoin to then exchange it for other Altcoins, so I hold very few Bitcoins.b.
EthereumThe second most popular currency is Ethereum.
It has scored itself the secondspot in the hierarchy of cryptocurrencies.
This digital currency, launched in2015, is predicted to surpass Bitcoin and may be the cryptocurrency of thefuture.Is Ethereum similar to Bitcoin?It is in a way, but not really.
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a part of a blockchainnetwork.
The main difference between the two currencies is that the Bitcoinblockchain focuses on tracking ownership of the digital currency while theEthereum blockchain focuses on running the programming code or network.27Instead of having to build an entirely original blockchain for each newapplication, Ethereum enables the development of thousands of differentapplications in a single platform.
In the Ethereum blockchain, miners work toearn Ether.
Ether is a crypto token that helps run the network.Another use of the Ethereum blockchain is its ability to decentralise anyservices that are centralised.
For instance, Ethereum is able to decentraliseservices like loans provided by banks, online transactions using PayPal as wellas voting systems and much more.Ethereum can also be used to build a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation(DAO).
A DAO is a fully autonomous organisation without a leader.
DAOs arerun by programming codes on a collection of smart contracts written in theEthereum blockchain.
DAO is designed to replace the structure of a traditionalorganisation and, like Bitcoin, eliminating the need for people and acentralised control.What problem does it solve?Ethereum solves the problems of legal contracts online, eliminating middlementaking fees from transactions.Firstly, a third party cannot make any changes to the data.
The system is alsotamper and corruption proof.
This is because Ethereum is built based on anetwork formed around a consensus which, as a result, makes censorshipimpossible.Secondly, just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is backed up by secure cryptography.Therefore, the applications are well protected against any form of hacking.Ethereum went from around $400 to a low of $149 to its current price of $317.Do I hold Ethereum?This is my second largest holding.
I bought into Ethereum on 10 separateoccasions as the price was falling from its high.
At time of writing that positionis up by 31%.c.
Ethereum Classic28A few years back someone hacked into an Ethereum-based application andstole millions.
There was an internal argument about whether this eventshould be allowed to happen or to go back in time and make good the moneyso no one loses out.
The purists whoargued that there is no going back inblockchain technology broke away to form the new Ethereum Classic.What problem does it solve?It is essentially the same as Ethereum, so it is unclear why we need two of thesame.
However, lately it is looking to distinguish itself from Ethereum.Do I hold Ethereum Classic?Yes, I have one position in Ethereum Classic which at time of writing is up220%.d.
RippleRipple was launched in 2012.What problem does it solve?Banks can use Ripple to make payments faster and cheaper nationally andinternationally.If you have sent money overseas, you will have used a SWIFT code which is anentity with a monopoly on border transfers – in 200 countries, with more than11,000 financial institutions forming its branches.However, Ripple while working together with financial services, banks andinstitutions wants to take down SWIFT and disrupt its functionality.Ripple is actually a technology that has a dual function; as a digital currency aswell as a digital payment network for financial transactions.Unlike the other cryptocurrencies, Ripple operates on an open-source and apeer-to-peer decentralised platform which allows a transfer of money in anyform, both fiat and cryptocurrency.29Ripple uses a middleman in the currency transactions.
The medium (themiddleman) known as “Getaway” acts as a link in the network between twoparties wanting to make a transaction.The way it works is that the Gateway functions as a credit intermediary thatreceives and sends currencies to public addresses over the Ripple network.This is why Ripple is less popular when compared to the other digitalcurrencies.
Also, many people don’t like Ripple because they believe thatcryptocurrencies is an answer to the domination of the current banking systemand Ripple works with the banks.Ripple acts as a bridge for other currencies which includes both fiat andcryptocurrencies.
In Ripple’s network, any currency can be exchanged betweenone another.If user X wants Bitcoins as the form of payment for his services from Y, then Ydoes not necessarily have to possess Bitcoins.
Y can pay X to X’s Gateway usingUS Dollars or any other currencies.
X will then receive Bitcoins converted fromthe US Dollars from his Gateway.The nature of Ripple’s network and its systems exposes its users to certainrisks.
Even though you are able to exchange any currencies, the Ripple networkdoes not run with a proof-of-work system like Bitcoin.
Instead, transactions areheavily reliant on a consensus protocol in order to validate account balancesand transactions on the system.But Ripple does improve some features of traditional banks.
Namely,transactions are completed within seconds on a Ripple network even thoughthe system handles millions of transactions frequently.With traditional banks, even a wire transfer may take up days or weeks tocomplete.
The fee to conduct transactions on Ripple is also very minimal, asopposed to large fees charged by banks to complete cross-border payments.Do I own Ripple?30I have three positions in Ripple due to a Tim Ferris podcast with Nick Szabo, thecreator of BitGold.
Nick said that the currencies that could cross the bridgebetween the current banking system and the new digital system would be thewinners.
Ripple is the first to attempt this.At time of writing, this position is up by 14%.e.
MoneroWhat problem does it solve?The technology solves the problem of privacy.
People who might be underdictatorship of governments can use Monero to keep their identity hidden.
Soit has a real function to help the underprivileged in the world regardless ofyour creed, colour, sex etc.
who might not be able to existing systems, not beable to open a bank account etc.Monero's main goal was to create an algorithm to add the privacy featuresthat is missing in Bitcoin.
Monero invented a system to conceal the identity ofits senders and recipients.The system combines a user’s private account keys with public keys obtainedfrom Monero’s blockchain to create a ring of possible signers that would notallow outsiders to link a signature to a specific user.While Monero users have the ability to keep their transactions private, theyare also able to share their information selectively.Monero has received the acceptance of multiple dark web marketplaces andhas generated its own fan base due to its privacy settings.
Therefore, it is lessspeculative as compared to other digital currencies and traders purchaseMonero as a hedge for other cryptocurrencies.Do I own Monero?Yes, I have three positions in Monero which at time of writing are up by 138%.f.
DashDash – Digital Cash is one of the most promising alternative coins to Bitcoin.31Dash is unlike other cryptocurrency projects like Ethereum or Stratis which aremore of a development platform.Dash advocates itself as peer-to-peer decentralised electronic cash.
It intendsto be as liquid as real cash which we use in our respective countries.Dash is built upon Bitcoin’s core code with the addition of new features (suchas privacy and quick transactions).Like Bitcoin, Dash is open-source and has its own blockchain, walletinfrastructure, and community.
But unlike Bitcoin, its transaction fee isnegligible.Moreover, it appears from the attitude of the development community thatDash will only remain as digital money for the Internet, which is a good thing.Dash is designed to have a total supply of 18 million coins.At present, the circulating supply of Dash is over 8 million and it will reach 18million in the year 2300.Do I own Dash?I only have one position which is up by 216%.
This is one I wish I had more of.
Iam looking for any weakness in the dollar price to get in again.g.
LitecoinWhen the currency was first launched, it aspired to be the ‘silver’ to Bitcoin’s‘gold’.The main reason of Litecoin’s creation is to make up what Bitcoin lacked.
Themain difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin is the 2.5 minute time togenerate a block for Litecoin, as opposed to Bitcoin’s 10 minutes.For miners and technical experts, the Litecoin possesses a very importantdifference to Bitcoin, and that is a more improved work algorithm whichspeeds up the hashing power and system altogether.One of the biggest advantages that Litecoin possesses is it can handle a highervolume of transactions thanks to its algorithm.
The faster block time alsoprevents double spending attacks.32While Litecoin failed to secure and maintain its second place after Bitcoin, it isstill actively mined and traded and is bought by investors as a backup in caseBitcoin fails.Do I own Litecoin?This is an interesting one because it has a lot of promise but it just doesn’tseem to be going in the right direction.
If it doesn’t do something soon it mightbe overtaken by some of the promising new coins like Dash.
I hold one positionwhich at time of writing is up by 22%.You can look up the market capitalisation and more information on theabove on www.coinmarketcap.com335.
Where is the value ofcryptocurrencies, how areprices determined andwhat could Bitcoin beworth in the future?“Bitcoin will go to $500,000 within three years or I willeat my own penis”- John McAfee, the founder of McAfee software and CEO of MGTCapital Investments and one of the largest Bitcoin miningcompanies in the world.5a.
Where is the value of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?Some people call Bitcoin and the blockchain ‘Internet 3.0’.
We understandwhy they may see it in this way, however, we have to be clear that Bitcoinis a different technology to the Internet.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are what iscalled a ‘Fat Protocol’.34For the Internet ‘HTTP’ is a protocol that defines how information is sent overthe Internet.
On the back of these protocols, programmers built applicationlike Facebook and Google.
While these protocols created an enormous value,most of the value was captured by the applications that were built on top ofthe Internet.
Meaning that the people who created HTTP didn’t make moneyand are relatively unknown.
However, the owners of Facebook and Googlebecame billionaires and are celebrated entrepreneurs.With Bitcoin and a platform like Ethereum, it is the actual network itself that isgenerating the value.
Tokenholders are the ones who are going to benefit.
Thevalue will be captured by those building and investing at the blockchainprotocol layer because of the financial incentives (tokens) that are part of thenetwork’s design.Participants of the network (users, developers, investors etc) are incentivisedto grow the blockchain network because as the network expands the tokensare going to be worth more.355b.
How Are prices determined?A.
The value of cryptocurrencies are dependent on the market, where theprices of various cryptocurrencies vary a lot and it is one of the mostfluctuating and volatile markets to date.B.
The price of cryptocurrencies, like any other products, is dependent ondemand and supply.
If more people demand a particular currency and itis short in supply, then the value increases.
More units are mined byminers to balance the flow.
However, most currencies limit the supply oftheir tokens.C.
Scarcity is an important factor when compared to fiat currencies.
Fiatcurrencies can be printed every day, making our money worth less everyyear.
Digital currencies, however, have limited supply.
For instance, thetotal amount of Bitcoin issued is only 21 million.
Therefore, Bitcoin’ssupply will decrease in time and will reach its final number by 2140.
Italso explains why Bitcoin’s value is higher compared to othercryptocurrencies.
Dash has the same idea, limiting itself to 18.9 million –this might explain why its price is also doing well.36D.
Trust.
This one is often overlooked but, like with any currency, tokenswill only have value if people have trust in it.
Trust comes from a lot ofsources such as the credibility of the developers, the kind of serviceprovided etc.5c.
What could the price of Bitcoin be?Well, this is the 64 million dollar question, isn’t it?A client of mine and I came up with quasi the same potential possible futurevaluation = $100,000 per Bitcoin.
This is how we calculated it – it’s not veryscientific.
If Bitcoin really is Liquid Gold and so becomes the new ‘GoldenStandard’ as a store of value, then you have to figure out the current value ofall the Gold in the world that has been mined.If that is valued at approximately 8 trillion dollars and if Bitcoin reaches thatsame level and there are only 21 million Bitcoins ever mined, then that wouldmean $400,000 per Bitcoin.
Important here is the scarcity factor – if that everchanged and more were created, then all bets are off.A multi-millionaire investor friend of mine once told me a long time ago that ifyou talk to a start up founder and they say their business is going to make xprofits in y time, and it would take z costs to do it, then it will probably be halfthe amount of profits, take double the amount of time and cost double theamount.
I have very much taken this to heart throughout my investing career.Therefore, on a potential valuation of $400,000 I would halve it and halve itagain.
That’s how I came up with a potential number of $100,000.
I told you,not very scientific.
It still leaves Bitcoin with a lot of upside.
I just don’t knowhow long it will take.
It’s going to take longer than you think.If you feel this valuation is not big enough, then there are others who believeBitcoin could go to $1 million valuation per Bitcoin.
John McAfee, the founderof McAfee software and CEO of MGT Capital Investments and one of thelargest Bitcoin mining companies in the world has publicly bet that Bitcoin willhit $500,000 within three years or he will eat his own penis.
That’s a dangerous37thing to say because I think due to its scarcity it will go up but I don’t knowWHEN.There are a few things that could act as a catalyst.
China has banned bitcoinbefore and unbanned it If it were to unban again then prices would explodeAlso when leverage comes in prices will explode –Now I hope Bitcoin hits $500,000 within three years for more than onereason…386.
How to make money withcryptocurrencies?There are many ways to make money with cryptocurrencies.
The four mostpopular ones are:1.
You can mine themThis is where you use your computer(s) to mine for Bitcoin i.e.
usethe computational power of your computer(s) to help verifycertain transactions on the blockchain and be rewarded withBitcoin or other coins.In my opinion there is not much money in it for the averageperson.2.
You can lend themThis is where traders who need margin and leverage borrow yourcoins to trade with.
They have to give them back to you with a %commission.3.
You can buy already established cryptocurrenciesThis is the topic of the following chapters.4.
You can buy new ICOsRecently there have been a flurry of new Initial Coin Offeringswhere, if you get it right, you can invest £1,000 and turn it into £10,000or even £100,000 in a relatively short period of time.
Therefore, we willalso be discussing this topic.When choosing cryptocurrencies, do your research.
Don't get caught up in thehype.
When you are researching, remember to ask:1.
"What problem is it solving?” If it doesn’t solve a problem then why wouldanyone use it or buy it? And392.
"Does it have the right team to solve that problem?"Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most widespread by far.
Imagine them like theReserve Currency of the crypto world – if you wanted to invest in othercryptos, then you have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum with your local currencyfirst.
Then you buy the other cryptocurrencies with your Bitcoin or Ethereum.If you don’t want to buy the cryptocurrencies themselves, you can always buya Bitcoin fund or Bitcoin tracker.
I did this for my daughter in her Junior ISA andit went up 98%, making her just under £2,000 in just three months.This might not seem like a lot of money but £2,000 in three months isn’t badfor an eight year old!What are the signs of a ‘bad’ cryptocurrencyAvoid these signs of a bad cryptocurrency1) Me-too coins – these are coins that do exactly the same as alreadyexisting coins and don’t really add any more benefits or USPs.
They arejust copying what has already been done.
Avoid these.
If, however, theyare sufficiently different and do the same but do it in a much better orfaster or cheaper way etc.
then it might be worth considering2) Coins for specific industries – what I mean by this is coins that aredesigned for just one market.
A perfect example is Potcoin.
I actuallybought some but I regret it now because all they are saying is “here is amarket and we are going to create a coin for this market so everyonecan use this coin to buy marijuana.” But in reality there is no real NEEDfor this coin.
It doesn’t solve any PROBLEMS.
You can use Bitcoin orMonero or Ethereum instead.
Worse still, there are other coins likeDopecoin, Cannabiscoin, Hempcoin doing the same thing.
Paragon, onthe other hand, is creating a platform for the Marijuana industry – I owntokens in Paragon too.403) Teams that are either too small or unqualified – in reality it is not easyto make a start up successful, and the competition is only going tointensify.
It is best to check out the backgrounds of the team and see ifthey really do have the experience to pull off what they are suggestingin their whitepaper.
Also, the team needs to be large enough to handlethis or at least they have to have plans to hire more relevant teammembers.
A one-man band or three people can’t dominate an industry.4) Low trading volume – it means that that not enough people are buyingand selling.
This is not a good sign.
You want to see ever-increasingvolume as the market is waking up to the opportunity.If you take care of the above then you should avoid the majority of coins thatare scams.417.
How to start buyingBitcoins, Ethereum andother AltcoinsGenerally, you have to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum with your fiat money first.Then you can buy other Altcoins with Bitcoin or Ethereum.There are two ways of buying Bitcoin – through an Exchange or Direct.1.
Exchangesa.
Fiat exchangeCryptocurrency exchanges are websites which allow you to buy, sell andexchange cryptocurrencies for other digital currencies or fiat currencies likeUSD or Euro.
Kraken is one of the largest.
When I started I used Gemini.The exchanges require you to open an account and verify your identification.Once you have exchanged fiat for Bitcoins, you can then either buy other coins,or in the case of Gemini, you have to then send your Bitcoins to Coinexchanges, like Poloniex, Bittrex or Coinbase (see below).b.
Coin Exchange42These are websites that connects buyers and sellers where they charge certainfees for a completed transaction.i.
ReputationBefore you start your exchange on your selected site, ensure you’ve gatheredsufficient information regarding the site such as reviews from professionaltraders as well as well-known industry websites.ii.
FeesMost exchanges will have fee-related information on their websites.
Beforejoining any sites, ensure you have understood the exchange jargons: deposit,transaction and withdrawal fees.
Fees may vary according to the exchange youchoose.iii.
Payment MethodsTake note of the payment method available.
Does the site use credit and debitcard? Wire transfer? PayPal? If a particular exchange has very limited paymentmethods then it may not be convenient for you.
Always remember thatpurchasing currencies via credit card will always require ID verification and itcomes with a premium price to increase the security measures.
Always checkthe fees for using credit or debit cards, as they can be very high.Meanwhile, purchasing cryptocurrency via wire transfer will take longer as ittakes time for banks to process.iv.
Verification RequirementsThe majority of Bitcoin’s trading platforms both in the US and the UK require aform of ID verification to make deposits and withdrawals.
Some exchanges willalso allow you to remain anonymous.
Bear in mind that verifications may takeseveral days but this is to protect exchanges from any sort of moneylaundering.v.
Exchange Rate43Do not be surprised that different exchanges offer different rates.
Therefore,always remember to shop around and to not immediately settle on anexchange.
This makes a big difference on your investment as cryptocurrencyrates are known to fluctuate in value up to 10% and even higher in somecircumstances.As cryptocurrency is gaining more attention around the globe, there is a vastarray of exchange platforms to choose from.
But not all exchange platformsare created equal.When I started I transferred GBP from my bank to a Fiat Exchange, like Geminiin USD, where I bought my Bitcoin.From there I would transfer money to my Coin Exchanges, Poloniex and/orBittrex.So I decided to open an account with an Exchange that was present in Europe,Kraken.
I could send my GBP direct in GBP to Kraken.
I would then exchangemy GBP for Bitcoin and then send it to either Poloniex or Bittrex.
RecentlyKraken stopped accepting GBP but people with Euros can still use it.c.
Examples of Coin Exchangesi.
Poloniex: this is the first one I ever used.44ii.
Bittrex: this is the second one I opened.Bittrex has one of the most numbers of coins to trade, that’s why Ilike it so much.
This is what Bittrex looks like once you have loggedin:iii.
Kraken: The third one I opened was Kraken.It is one of the largest exchanges in Europe.
Now that it no longeraccepts GBP I don’t find it as useful, however our Continentalfriends can still use it to send their Euros and purchase Bitcoin.Since the selection of other coins are limited however, unless youare thinking of just holding Bitcoin, Ethereum and some of theother larger coins, you will probably be sending your money toexchanges such as Bittrex or Poloniex.45iv.
Coinbase: this is the best known.
No idea why I haven't used it butI haven't :-)Actually while writing this book I realised that I probably shouldopen an account with Coinbase and have even made a video onhow to open the account for the members of our Crypto Club.46An important note: Opening these accounts is simple but it is not easy.
We areat the beginning of a new technology here.
Things are getting better but as abeginner it might seem very convoluted at first, some might say downrightconfusing.This is a GOOD thing.
It keeps the masses away while you and I get ourpositions.
Once the doors open, everyone will want to get in.
We will be in agreat position once that happens.
So be grateful that it is not easy to open anaccount, otherwise everyone would be doing it right now :-)2.
DirectOne of our traders here used www.localbitcoins.com to exchange GBP intoBitcoin (BTC).
“I found a seller selling BTC at a predetermined price, got myselfverified as per their instructions.
And then made a bank transfer to them.
TheBTC were held in escrow until payment was received.
As soon as the paymenthas been confirmed the BTC are released.
I then transferred my BTC from thesite into an exchange.”For an idea of UK exchanges, check out www.bittybot.co/uk for a list of all UKBitcoin exchanges and other exchanges which trade in British Pounds (GBP)ordered by ask price (lowest first).47As always, please do your own research and due diligence.488.
Which strategies do I use?“After spending many years in Wall Street and after makingand losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: it neverwas my thinking that made the big money for me.
It alwayswas my sitting.
Got that? My sitting tight!”- Jesse Livermore, Millionaire TraderOnce we have opened up our accounts, we can start to invest in the coins.All you need now is a strategy.
Most people do not have a strategy which theyhave thought about in advance, written down and then follow to the letter.That is the biggest mistake of all.
Before we start getting into the strategy, hereare a few other mistakes you should try to avoid at all costs:Mistake 1:They invest in something they don’t really understand or believe in long term.Therefore, they are too easily tempted to sell if the price begins to fall in theshort term.To counteract this mistake, start by sticking to the major ones in terms ofmarket capitalisation ie top ten for safety first while you test the market(www.coinmarketcap.com).49If you want something a little bit more advanced with more gadgets but thatbasically does the same thing, then try www.coingecko.comSome people prefer Coingecko because it has its own rating system that takesmore information into consideration before ranking, whereas Coinmarketcaponly uses the market capitalisation to rank it.It is up to you which one you want to use but Coingecko does have morefunctionality:50Mistake 2:They think they have missed the boat on the most successful cryptocurrencies,whose price has run up – think Bitcoin and Ethereum – and so invest in lessestablished, smaller and more speculative coins just because the price is muchcheaper than that of Bitcoin and so have more of an upside.While you can put a small 10% of your money into speculation, the majority ofyour money needs to go into any of the pull-backs that occur on the moreestablished cryptocurrencies.
A pull-back is a fall in price significant enough forus to enter eg 10% from a recent high.Mistake 3:They try to day trade and profit from short term market movements, both upand down.While this can undoubtedly be profitable for someone who knows what theyare doing, this is absolutely lethal for anyone who doesn’t know proper riskmanagement and who doesn’t have a strategy or has a strategy without theproper risk:reward ratios.
Anyone who doesn’t have this is going to get killedby the volatility.51There are many different strategies you can use.
Fundamental analysis relieson data to determine the long term trend of the market and, therefore, thereis very little to do.
Technical analysis, on the other hand, is the study of shortterm movements in the price.Some people claim that technical analysis, often made up of a myriadcombination of hundreds of different chart patterns and indicators to help youenter the market, can give you an edge.Maybe.I particularly like the picture below where a trader makes fun of technicalanalysis.
It says “I have decided to brush up on TA (Technical Analysis) so I canbe an expert.
Looks like a Yeti pattern is forming.
I can confirm $150 pricetarget!” Hilarious!For people starting out, technical analysis can be confusing.
So what to do?The answer is: keep it simple.52What do to with a bull cryptocurrencyMy advice would be to do as little as possible and allow the market to do thework, especially in a bull market as we have now.
I am not advocating buy andhold.
Rather, to buy on the dips and sell 20-50% of your profit as it goes backup but hold on to the rest for when the big move comes.Take a look at the chart of Bitcoin below.
There were plenty of opportunities toget in on pull-back in the price and then to gradually sell on the way up.Just keep doing it.
Rinse and Repeat.
The only caveat, and it is a big caveat, isthat you do need to believe that it is going to continue up.If it stops going up, then you have to use the following strategy.What do to with a sideways or slightly down cryptocurrencyWhen starting out, we suggest you don’t try to time the market too much i.e.try to get in and out like a professional trader.
Use a simple yet effectivestrategy like Value Cost Average™ strategy.
The rules are as follows:53Buy the currency at when it has dropped -10% from a recent high and again at-20% from the recent high and again at -30% from the recent high.
Draw yourlines in advance, so you get in according to the strategy.
Make sure you arelooking at a chart which shows the crypto in relation to something stable, NOTin relation to Bitcoin.
If you can’t find that then write down the price at whichyou are going to enter in advance.
Each time increase the amount you areinvesting by not more than 25%.Remember that cryptocurrencies have massive volatility.
Do not get emotionalabout this.
Expect it.
Embrace it even.
Volatility is your friend so you can buy ata cheaper price.
While everyone else is panicking, you will be entering again.Take a look at the chart below of Monero (Ticker XMR)There were plenty of opportunities to buy on the pull-back and make a fairlyfast 10% with this strategy.
And Monero is one of the more stable ones.
Eventhe biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is EXTREMELY volatile.That is why these strategies work so well – because of the volatility ofcryptocurrencies.
See the following chart:54It shows Bitcoins’ major corrections.
A correction is more of fall then a merepull-back.
When you look at the % declines in Column 4 each time, you will seewhat we mean by volatility.
Let volatility be your friend.
Buy on the dips.Only use this strategy if you are sure your chosen coin cannot go to zero –stick to the top ten with the biggest market capitalisations.If you are investing more speculatively because you want to take on more riskto make more potential returns then you need to know what you are doing.This is not recommended for total beginners.
For example, you could buyothers Altcoins that aren’t in the top 10 or so.
But remember the further downthe list you go the more risk you are taking that it could go to zero.If you are taking on more risk then don't keep buying into it because if it goesto zero all your money will be gone.
Here you have to be clever.
Try onlybuying when it has dropped AND you see it going up again.But remember, this strategy can only work on something you believe will notgo to zero.
If you believe that Bitcoin or any other Altcoin can go to zero, donot employ this strategy.Never invest more than you are willing to lose entirely.
People always saythat but with cryptocurrencies I suggest you heed this advice.559.
How to keep yourcryptocurrencies safe andstore them“I threw away $7.6 Million of Bitcoin”- Campbell Simpson, who bought $25 worth of Bitcoin in 2010, put it on ahard drive but threw the hard drive away by mistake.To start investing in cryptocurrencies, the first thing you would need is to setup your digital wallet.
In the cryptocurrency realm, the term used is “wallet”.The wallet can be likened to a bank account, which can be stored in differentdevices.The reason you need to do this is because there are countless stories of peoplelosing their cryptocurrencies.
Safety is paramount here – you don’t want tobuild up a small fortune only to lose it all.A cryptocurrency wallet is a software program that functions to store yourprivate and public keys and interacts with various blockchains.
It enables usersto send and receive cryptocurrencies as well as tracking their balance.There are many wallets out there for you to choose from, which is alldependent on your security needs as well as whether you wish to be an activetrader or a more passive buy-and-hold investor (we recommend you be amixture of the two, the so-called sweet spot).Once you have set up your wallet, you can then proceed to purchase andexchange the digital currency of your choice on many platforms.There are three main ways to store your coins:561.
An exchange – this is the easiest way because you are trading yourmoney on there so that is where your money is kept.
However,remember that this is an unregulated entity and this is where most ofthe hacks have taken place.
So to date, exchanges have been the worstplace to keep your money.Make it even safer by using whatever extra security there is available.For example, Gemini asks not just for a password but asks if you want toenable ‘Two-Factor Authentication’ (2FA).
Do it! It makes it even safer.Use ‘Google Authenticator’ where possible as opposed to text messagingin case someone clones your phone.Some of the exchanges actually hold your coins in cold storage for you,so theoretically that sounds a little bit safer than just keeping it on anexchange that doesn’t offer that.2.
An online Wallet –a.k.a.
Hot Wallet.
This is more difficult to hack andtherefore safer than an exchange.
It can still be hacked, however, since itis online.
It also means more work because you have to open up severalwallets for each of the different coins.
This is a pain but do it.
Better tobe safe than sorry.There are two ways of doing this:1.
Ones that store your public key and your private key online and2.
Those that are set up online but then store your private keys on yourPC or mobile.1.
Online or Cloud WalletSome examples of these are www.MyEtherWallet.com (which I use) andwww.blockchain.info (which I have not used).57Once you used www.myetherwallet.com there is no turning back.
It isextremely simple to use, once you have used it a few times of course :--)2a.
Desktop PC/Mac WalletDepending on how secure your desktop is or isn’t, this is accessible by hackersi.e.
if your PC gets a virus then people can hack it to get your private keys.2b.
Mobile WalletThe best-known mobile wallet is Jaxx.
It syncs to your desktop and your phoneso that you can back up the private key.
You can download it from the AppStore or Google Play.
www.jaxx.io58Jaxx is great because it stores a lot of different coins all in one, like Bitcoin,Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash etc.3.
An offline Wallet a.k.a.
Cold storage or hard storage – this is whereyou store your private key on a special USB stick and so it is off grid.
Onceoffline, it is almost impossible to hack.
However, if the cleaner throws it out,you lose it for good.
And yes, this has happened with people losing$millions in hard disks that were thrown out by mistake.The most popular ones are:Trezor: this was the first original hard wallet.Like most of these technologies, they are SIMPLE to use but noteasy.
The first time it is like climbing a mountain – but every useafter that gets easier and easier.Before long you will be an absolute expert at it, showing off to allyour friends.
If you didn’t die climbing the mountain the first timearound, that is.Ledger Nano S: one of the most popular.The Ledger seems to be very popular with people.
It is almost thesame as the Trezor but looks cooler and is less expensive.
Isuppose those are two good reasons when buying something,especially since it pretty much does the same thing as the Trezor.59I went for the Trezor because it was more expensive (reassuringlyexpensive and all that) but now that I have been in the space for awhile, if I would start again I would probably go for the LedgerNano.KeepKey:Keepkey aas a larger screen but I have not used it myselfWith all of the above, you have to figure out your number that you thinkit is safer to put on there i.e.
any coins worth more than $25,000 in valueI use a cold storage wallet.4.
Paper Wallet.
This is where you literally write down your private keyon a piece of paper.
This is, of course, much cheaper than buying one ofthe above.Make sure you keep a copy because once the paper is destroyed yourprivate key is gone and your coins will be gone.With all the above, follow these three Rules:1.
Always back up your wallet, no matter which ones you use.2.
Keep your software up to date if using software.603.
Use whatever extra security there is available such as TwoFactor Authentication.
Use Google Authenticator wherepossible as opposed to text messaging in case someone clonesyour phone.Summary: If you are planning to trade with your money (not invest),then leave it on the exchange, but if you are planning to hold it longer termthen it is worth keeping it safe in a wallet.If you have larger investments – you need to decide what that means – itis definitely worth putting into cold storage.Better safe than sorry!6110.
How to track them onceyou have bought them?“If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.”- Management thinker Peter DruckerThere are several sites you can use to track your cryptocurrenciesonce you have bought them.The one that I use is www.cryptocompare.com.62You can either put in what you have bought manually or you cutand paste a code from the exchange in and it does itautomatically.
This way it has the fluctuations of all the coins on adaily basis:This is a great way to track all your holdings even if they are onseveral exchanges or several wallets.
You don’t want to be logginginto several exchanges every day – simply log into your ‘Portfolio’in CryptoCompare and everything you want is there.
If you haveseveral positions of the same coin, it will amalgamate it and giveyou the average price.Another one is www.Cointracking.info.63This has the added benefit of having a tax add on.
Again, you canenter coins directly from exchanges such as Bittrex, Coinbase,Kraken etc.6411.
How to make money i.e.when to sell them“The only people who lose money are the ones that have tosell.”- Warren BuffettThis, of course, is the holy grail of trading – WHEN to get out of the trade.We are at the beginning of cryptocurrencies as a technology, so there could beenormous upside potential.
We are looking at the maximum upside.
If there isone thing I have learned it is that you have to allow your winners to run if youwant to make a lot of money.
We are definitely holding for the long-termupside potential.In this bull market and in the Early Adopter stage of cryptocurrencies, I don’treally want to be selling.
Why? Unlike other investments, Bitcoin and othercryptocurrencies are currencies and, so if they succeed, you won’t have to sellthem to gain value from them.
You can use them directly, like you can theBritish Pound or any other form of currency.I am not even going to buy something with a stop loss to sell, as the volatility istoo huge at the moment.
I am not really looking at selling at all, since we are ina bull market and if I get out I will miss out on the big moves that comes whenyou least expect it.However, to just buy and hold is a pretty lazy strategy too.
You don’t want tobe up massively and then lose all the profits you made.
So we have to considertaking some profits now and again in order to take money off the table androtate it back into other cryptos that might be at a lower price.
For example, ifyou are in profit and have made over 100%, it is time to think about setting astop loss just below it to sell a part of your holdings and take some profit, say20-30%.65Another way to make money is a little more advanced and it means watching iton a daily basis if you see the price continuously going up and down i.e.
goingsideways and not really hitting new highs, then you can start to trade withinthat ‘channel’ of high and low prices.
So you are getting in near the bottomand out near the top – in effect trading – whilst always keeping your mainamount invested but start trading a smaller portion within that range.It is important to do this but most people do not do this.
If you don’t do thisthen you don’t make any money while markets go sideways which is crazywhen you consider that markets might go sideways for many months, evenyears on occasions.
If you don’t trade the range while waiting for the eventualupturn, you have missed out on that time … and profit.This is the optimal strategy but takes some experience.
Not a lot of experiencebut a little.Make sure you talk to one of our traders who can guide you and point you inthe right direction.6612.
Is it too late to get intocryptocurrencies – have Imissed the boat?Get in before the early adoption really starts.While it might be too late to make 10,000% on the larger coins, it is still veryearly on and new developments, coins and ideas are being generated almoston a daily basis.
We are just at the start.
There will no doubt be NEW cryptosthat will also have meteoric rises which you can get into.
Some haven’t evenbeen invented yet.
Anything could happen.
Get involved.Whether you are in the know and can buy in time is another matter altogether,so do your research and get going.A whole generation is looking at Bitcoin as a store of value.
The trust is in thedecentralised framework of the blockchain, which makes it so difficult to hackinto.
Anyone under the age of 30 sees Bitcoin as making total sense.There are generally four phases of adoption according to Everett M.
Rogers(1957)1.
Innovators2.
Early Adopters3.
Late Majority4.
Laggards67I believe that we are only now approaching the Early Adopter’s stage, so plentyof time to go.
At the moment only thousands of people own any Bitcoin or afraction of a Bitcoin.
This is akin to when only hundreds of thousands of peoplehad an iPhone.
The real growth came when it started being adopted byeveryone and then it grew into the high millions.
So get in before the earlyadoption really starts.Simon Dixon, CEO and co-founder of BNK to the Future, says that he has seenfive waves of cryptocurrencies:1.
The first wave was Bitcoin, which had value because of it being a store ofvalue independent of a central bank.2.
The second was the Altcoins where people were trying to copy Bitcoin.Some of them succeeded, like Litecoin and Dash.3.
Then you had equities in companies, like the exchanges Kraken andCoinbase.4.
Then there was Tokens or ‘ICOs’ as they are called, where companiescreate an asset class that trades on a secondary market.685.
The final one is ‘Forks’ – where people have disagreements on howthings should be done and split off, for example Ethereum Classic splitoff from Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold split off fromBitcoin.Let us take a look at ICOs in the next chapter.6913.
What is an ICO and howcan I profit from it?Let’s ICO like it’s 1999.* Important warning before we start: ICOs are a high-risk way of fundraising.Never invest anything you can’t completely afford to lose.
Keep in mind thatdue to a lack of regulation, you will have difficulty getting back your lost moneyin case of any failures.What is an ICO?An ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a fundraising method that trades future cryptocoins for cryptocurrencies which have an immediate, liquid value.
Much as anIPO is an Initial Public Offering when a private company decides to go public onan Exchange, an ICO is an Initial Coin Offering.
ICOs or Initial Coin Offerings arebasically crowd sales, the cryptocurrency version of crowdfunding.The only difference is that in an ICO the startup sells tokens on a blockchainwhile IPO is selling shares.
It usually takes place before the launch of a coin’sblockchain, and involves the public sale, or crowdsale, of a percentage of thecoin’s initial supply.
ICOs are sometimes referred to as ICPOs (Initial Public CoinOfferings) or ITOs (Initial Token Offerings) or even a ‘Crypto Crowdsale’.
Thestartups themselves are called ‘Blockchain Startups’.Many of the companies performing ICOs aren’t offering coins, but rathertokens.
And tokens and coins are very different things.
Coins, like Bitcoin, are away of transferring monetary value.
Tokens, on the other hand, can storecomplex and multifaceted data streams that can be used for endlessfunctionality.70Many of the new companies that are holding ICOs are not currencies and areinstead technology companies that will be built on the blockchain.
So, theycan’t be judged solely on their monetary value, but rather they need to beevaluated based on their business model and potential solution.What is the so-called ‘white paper’ within an ICO?Every ICO should have a white paper or manifesto.
For example, the originalBitcoin white paper is at the back of this book (see appendices).
This detailshow the technology is intended to work, how the tokens are designed within it,and how users could acquire and use the tokens.
A white paper shows whetherthe founders have thought through the project, what problem it solves andhow they mean to solve it.
Crucially, it must also show how the tokens they aregiving out will be used to solve the problem, since you will own some inexchange for investing.How does an ICO work?1.
A startup advertises that it will be selling the initial coin supply of their newcryptocurrency.2.
Investors read the ‘white paper’ of the startup and on that basis exchangeBitcoin or Ether for these new coins.3.
The startup can then exchange your Bitcoin or Ether into normal fiatcurrency to spend on building out the technology, pay for costs etc.4.
If the project is a success, ie it launches and starts being adopted, then thevalue of the new currency rises and investors of the ICO make a profit.Why do companies do them?ICO provides them a simpler and quicker way to do fund-raising for newblockchain projects than a traditional method.
It is also border-free that it canconnect to every investor in the world.Usually, a percentage of the tokens is sold to ICO participants and a percentagekept for the company’s needs (private investors, etc.
Terms differ from one ICOto another).71Bancor raised $150 million in under 3 hours.
BAT raised $34 million in literallyunder a minute.
The ICOfor Status was in such a high demand that it jammedthe Ethereum network for an entire day.
The highest value raised by an ICO isTezos, which raised a record breaking $232 million in less than a month!How do you make money in an ICO?Most investors speculate that the startup will be successful enough to launchon an exchange, so that they can sell their tokens or coins as soon as possible,at profit.
They don’t necessarily believe in the company itself, or they mightbelieve in the idea, but are not willing to risk staying in for the long term if theycan make 100-1000% in the short term.What does the new token/coin represent?The coin/token issued in an ICO has three roles, depending on the goals of thecompany:72 It represents the company’s product – the coins can be used as a medium ofexchange for a certain amount of product or services.
It could also be usedfor trading in a project. It represents the right of profit sharing – like normal shares, the coins couldbe thought of a certain percent of a company’s shares you own and profitscould be shared if the company wishes to do so. It represents corporate bonds – the coin is like a loan.
The coin owner isable to receive interest based on the pre-set rate.Those that believe in the company will hold on for the long term.
If the startupis successful, fortunes will be made.
Even if you invest just £500-5,000.
This isunprecedented.Are there drawbacks to investing in ICOs?Yes, there are many.The idea for the startup is written on a ‘white paper’ – often even without anyproof of work – and people invest on the basis of what they read in the whitepaper.
Since investors are pouring in their money in the hope of becoming richthrough ICOs, some of these ICO startups are taking advantage of thissituation.
They collect the money but don’t actually get to the work of creatingthe product, yet alone actually turning the business into a profit-makingenterprise.
Then they just disappear into the ether.Mycelium ICO was a particularly bad example of this.
Its team members justdisappeared after raising the money, and later it was reported they used thefunds to pay for their own vacation.This is why there is so much talk of regulation and self-regulation.The ones that are legitimate and really do want to create a product may havethe problem of insufficient technical knowledge or support.
They may beunderqualified and lack the experience of building up a blockchain business.73This is not the only way investors have lost money.
$7 millions were stolen asCoinDash’s ICO started.
Right before the start of the token sale, their websitewas hacked and the ICO wallet address was changed to the hacker’s address.How do I go about investing in an ICO?1.
Research, research, researchUnlike an IPO where the company is normally successful and profitable, an ICOis a startup and needs the funds to get from the white paper theory to developthe actual product or service.
So you must do your research by trawling theInternet and asking all your questions on ICO, cryptocurrencies and Bitcoinforums.
Remember, you could lose 100% of your investment.1.
Can the team deliver based on its experience?Read their white paper and go straight to the founding members and the team.Look at their profiles on LinkedIn.
See how much history they have in the space– we are looking for people who can deliver on their promise.
If not, don’teven bother continuing.
Find out if the team has any crypto experience and –more importantly – which projects, or ICOs, they were involved with and theimpact they had.
If you are satisfied that they can deliver, continue yourresearch.Take a short cut and go to BitcoinTalk.org, because you can see what theexperienced investors are saying.74Watch out for the words like ‘scam’ and how the community responds.
Givemore weight to the answers of experienced investors.
Investor’s concerns willbe answered (or may be unanswered) in this thread.Also, it is a bad sign when the developers avoid answering certain questions oraren’t collaborating.
Sending them a personal message to see how responsivethey are is also a good idea.2.
Does the idea solve a problem/is the idea needed?Is there any validity in their idea? Is it solving a problem? Is there a potentialhungry market for this? Does it have a chance of succeeding? What does yourgut instinct and experience tell you? After reading it, you should be able toanswer a simple question – what kind of value does this project bring to ourworld?Next, is it a totally new concept or are they developing something thatsomeone else already has developed.
Don’t get duped into a new Amazon forthis new market or an Uber of that new market.
It can’t just be a ‘me-too’product – don’t invest unless you believe that this company can do it muchbetter.753.
What is the Token for?ICOs mean the creation of a new dedicated token for the project.
One of themost important questions each project needs to answer is what is the tokenfor? Why isn’t Bitcoin or Ethereum enough to serve as the project’s token?4.
How much money is being collected?Some of the earlier ICOs were unlimited.
An open cap allows investors to sendunlimited funding to the project’s ICO wallet.
The more coins are circulating,the less unique your tokens become for trading afterwards – through lessdemand.5.
What are they using the money for?Next, what are they using the money for? What percentage will go to thedevelopment budget, the marketing budget, and other essential allocations.
Inthe past, many ICOs have not given this level of transparency but in the enddon’t you want to know where your money is going to be allocated to and ifthis makes sense to you?6.
Token valueNext, look at the Token value – is the current value worth it? Do you think ithas a chance of growing in value to make you enough profits? Do they havetoo many tokens on offer which will saturate the market? Are there really anyincentives to use their tokens – because in the end, even if it is a great idea,you will only make money if the tokens you have will increase in value overtime? Etc.If you can answer these questions as best you can, then you have done thework required to lower the risk of investing.
Remember that your risk is 100%and with several of them, this is likely to happen.7.
Token distribution – when and how76Greed can be defined by a high token distribution to the team members, let’ssay, more than 50% of the tokens is suspicious.
A good project will link itstoken distribution to the roadmap,because each phase or milestone of theproject requires a certain amount of funding.Watch for the token distribution stage.
Some projects just release their tokenshours after the ICO has ended.
Some projects need to develop a beta versionbefore sending out the tokens.
This is good to know but doesn’t necessarilyhave to impact your investment decision2.
Exchange your fiat money for cryptocurrencyYou will need cryptocurrency, usually Bitcoin or Ethereum, to participate in anICO.
Remember the startup will then exchange your investment money for fiatmoney to pay for its development, costs etc.3.
Invest in ICOSimply send the cryptocurrency the startup asks for to the address they askyou to send it to.
Please note that most startups won’t accept Bitcoin or Etherfrom an exchange.
Several exchanges won’t send Bitcoin or Ether to an ICOstartup.
Normally it is sent from an online wallet e.g.
www.myetherwallet.com4.
Follow the development of the startupMany people just leave their money in the startup and pray it all works out.
Iam not one of those people.
I try to get involved and see if I can help.
After all,this is my money I have invested and I want to ensure that it works for me.
Ieven spent six months in a startup manning the phones.
Tell everyone about it,be a walking, talking advertisement for them.
You just never know the impactthis could have.Remember, investment in cryptocurrency isn’t something to be taken lightly.It’s extremely risky, extremely speculative, and extremely early stage still atthis point in time.I have now invested in over 30 ICOs.
I am spreading my risk because I don’tknow which of them will be successful, if any.
This is pure speculation.
But I77also swore that I would not miss out on what so far looks like a once in ageneration opportunity.I attend as many conferences as I can so I can talk to the team.
I read thewhitepaper.
I might send them an email to see how they react.I have even managed to get in on a pre-sale where it is possible to getdiscounts.
They were asking for a minimum of 100 ETH but when I remindedthem that we had met at the conference and of the conversation we had, theycame down to 50 and then finally 25 ETH.Morale of the story?If you don’t ask you don’t get.And attend conferences to meet the team.
There’s only so much you can gleanfrom a Whitepaper.7814.
Asset allocation – howmuch to invest incryptocurrencies?Overall, there is a school of thought that says that investing in ICOs is notinvesting at all – it is pure speculation and it is best to wait until after the ICO ieafter the coins have gone public.
I certainly agree with the first part of thatstatement – it is speculation to invest in a brand new startup that hasn’t evenbuilt its product at the start of a new technology revolution.
I also agree thatyou would be better of looking at the ones that have gone public as they havemore chance of not being scams.However, I don’t believe that is all we should be doing.
I believe that in termsof asset allocation a tiny amount of your portfolio should be invested on ICOsbecause the returns could be gigantic.
So what’s the ideal percentage? Thiswill, of course, depend on how old you are, how much risk you are willing totake and how aggressive/conservative you want to be.
However, for me, it isthe following:In terms of asset allocation I am looking at putting 5% of my capital into ICOs.The reason is that we have no idea:1.
Where this industry is heading.2.
Which ICOs are going to be successful.Therefore investing in ICOs is EXTREMELY speculative.However.
I am still open to putting in a small amount every month, say £500+.I am looking to spread my risk among a minimum of 20 different ICOs.
I will putmore in if I have met the people and get a good feeling about it, or the whitepaper makes a lot of sense and it is really solving a problem and has the team79to build the required solution.
So if I bought into 20 of them and they all failedbut one of them exploded, then I would risk £10,000 to make £50,000 or evenmore.For example, I might invest:0.5% of my capital into an ICO where I am not sure but want to be in because Idon’t want to miss out.1-1.5% of my capital into an ICO where I feel good about it.2.5-5% of my capital into an ICO where I really have a very good feel about theproblem, solution and the team.The most I have invested into one ICO is 12.5% of my crypto capital.
This wasat the beginning of my journey and it was, in hindsight, too much in terms ofasset allocation.Let’s break this down:25% = £2,500 into the top 2 Ethereum/Bitcoin.40% = £4,000 into established coins e.g.
top 20.20% = £2,000 into up and coming coins ie outside the top 20 but coming upfast.10% = £1,000 into new coins that have gone public onto an exchange.5% = £500 into ICOs.100% TotalThis is just a guideline on what I am doing – you need to come up with yourown system that works for you.Remember that this 100% is the 100% of the total of my pot allocated tocryptocurrencies.
Since cryptocurrencies are speculative, this ‘100%’shouldn’t be more than 10% of your entire portfolio.
So if you lost the entire100% then you would have only lost 10% of your portfolio.
Again, none of usknow what the future is of cryptocurrencies (see next chapters).
Buyerbeware!8015.
Are there any drawbacksto investing incryptocurrencies?“Where there’s blockchain there’s also bullshit”Overheard at a Blockchain ConferenceThere are several drawbacks to cryptocurrencies, especially with ICOs.
This is atotally new and unregulated industry, meaning if you are hacked and someonetakes your Bitcoins, you will not be compensated.
Also, new launches of coinsare increasing and no one knows which ones will vanish and which ones arehere to stay.
Due to this uncertainty, price swings of 30%+ in a single day up ordown are not uncommon.
Therefore, at the moment, only invest money youare willing to lose.Overall, there are four disadvantages of cryptocurrencies.
There is a lack ofunderstanding towards this digital currency.
Plus, there’s minimum protectionand guarantee when using is.
Because it is mostly operating online, it is boundto experience all kinds of technical flaws and it is still developing.1.
Lack of understanding about cryptocurrencyIn most cases, people are still unaware of the digital currency world and thepotential it holds.
This is similar to when the usage of credit card was firstannounced and the reception towards it was fairly similar to cryptocurrency.Back then, people wouldn’t even think that paying for things using a mere cardwas possible, yet alone a whole new digital currency.Because it is different, and it doesn’t involve cash directly, people shy awayfrom it and constantly doubt its effectiveness.
Additionally, it involves onlineaccess to make it work.
The idea of having to pay for things or transfer moneyonline is convenient to some and is catching on but some people are stillsceptical about it.81In order to make cryptocurrency acceptable around us, the people need to beeducated about it to be able to include it in their daily lives.
But the effort tolearn a whole new world of currency requires a lot of time and energy.
Mostwould think it is not worth their time because it is not commonly knownanyway.Even though some businesses are accepting Bitcoins, the list is significantlysmall compared to traditional currencies.
This is probably due to the lack ofknowledge.
Both businesses and customers need to be educated.
Imaginehaving to teach your customers a new way of paying for something.
This willtake a longer time and effort.2.
Lack of consumer protection and guaranteeIn the case of traditional currency, Central Banks govern the authority of anation’s money.
No higher authority can suddenly decide that they no longerwant to use their country’s currency to trade without protest and rejection.There are procedures to follow, documents to file, approvals and many otherprotocols to follow.However, that is not the case with our digital currency.
There is no CentralBank who governs Bitcoin, which means no one can guarantee its minimumvaluation.The value of Bitcoin, for example, will fall tremendously should a major groupof merchants decided to just ‘discard’ Bitcoins and leave the system.
This willinevitably leave other users who have invested thousands of dollars intoBitcoins in a major loss position.
There is no one to contact to file these losses,or rules to help compensate it.Another example is that if you get charged but didn’t receive the online movietickets or flight tickets, you can always call bank service provider, or go to thephysical bank instead and declare your case.
If you pay via Visa and can proveyou didn’t get your service, the credit card company will give you your moneyback.
I remember paying £2,000 for a course that was not delivered – the guyjust ran away with our money.
Visa compensated us fully because we usedtheir credit card.
I was actually pretty impressed at the time … and horrified, asI can imagine a lot of people putting in false claims.82That is not how it works with cryptocurrency.
First of all, this currency does nothave a bank to negotiate and help you.
There is no number that you could calland ask to speak to someone or email address.So, if you bought your goods using Bitcoins, for example, and the merchantdidn’t send the items you purchased, there is nothing you can do to reversethe transaction or refund.
You can’t complain to the police or any relatingauthority for that matter.Cryptocurrency transactions are typically not reversible.
Once you have sentthe money to an address you can’t get it back.
So make sure you double checkthat you are sending coins to the right address and in the right currency.Therefore, the very appeal of the decentralised system of Bitcoin is a doubleedged sword.3.
Technical shortcomingsWhen online banking made its way into our lives, there was always the risk of asudden server failure, power shortage, and even hardware lags.Similar to data corruptions or virus infections, if your hard drive crashes andyour wallet file is corrupted your Bitcoin is lost forever.
There is nothing youcan you do restore it and those ‘coins’ will be ‘orphaned’ in the system.So remember, always make a back-up to prevent this from happening.4.
The industry is still developingWhen things are still developing, they are prone to many risks.
There are somany incomplete features that can be improved but it takes a longer time tofinalise them, especially if they have no physical form.With traditional currency, despite the method of payments being performedonline, and without us actually seeing the physical money being transferredfrom one account to another, we still end up holding the physical cash at theend of the day.
We can use the physical cash to buy things from the stores,physically and online.Since cryptocurrency does not have any physical form i.e.
we will never beholding the physical cash, its usage is obviously restricted.83In the end it more often than not – and I hope this changes soon – but Bitcoinneeds to be converted to traditional currency to enjoy its worth.8416.
The future ofcryptocurrencyLunatic fringe or serious business?I do think cryptocurrency is here to stay.
To suggest otherwise would be likesaying the Internet was a fad when it first started.
Of course, hindsight is agreat thing.Which cryptos are here to stay, however, is almost impossible to guess.These digital currencies have been said to be able to capture the world ofonline finance.
With the blockchain technology behind it, the future ofcryptocurrency is showing enormous potential.Although the mechanism behind Ether prevents it from being used as a directpayment method, this cryptocurrency seems to have a bright future ahead.This is all thanks to its smart contract concepts.On the other hand, cryptocurrencies solving the problem of privacy are startingto gain more prominent favour amongst users.The growing level of acceptance of Bitcoin is clearly bringing this alternativecurrency to the mainstream.
Some companies are genuinely consideringinvesting in this currency, further fuelling its journey to the world of financialcurrency.Consider this:Ten times more money was raised for ICOs than Venture Capital in 2017.More than 50 Funds concentrating on cryptocurrencies have sprung up.All major VS are now on board and investing before ICOs.Countries such as Japan have even formally accepted it as a currency.85However, we need to differentiate between cryptocurrencies and theblockchain.
Cryptocurrencies have entered a speculation phase where peoplewant to make 1000% within days of buying a coin.
But that means we aredeparting from the fundamental assumption of what a cryptocurrencyoriginally is – a scarce digital commodity where the value derives from thatscarcity.Simply put, if more than 100 new sources of this digital commodity have beenlaunched since the summer of 2017, then the entire concept of scarcity, andtherefore value, begins to erode.
In fact, many of these new cryptocurrencieswill need to fail in order to maintain the viability of the best-known currencies,Bitcoin and Ether.Most of the recent ICOs are based on the ERC-20 Ethereum token, and theprimary purchasing mechanism for new cryptocurrencies has been Ether, thecurrency of the Ethereum network.Therefore, an investor often needs to buy Ether in order to buy into any of thenew ICOs.But the crypto bubble of lesser-known currencies will have to pop at somestage, and some people are going to get burned.
Despite this, the coretechnology behind it all – the blockchain – will provide value as a hiddeninfrastructure underlying future applications.A small number of currencies – likely Bitcoin and Ethereum – and utility tokenswhere genuine value is created, will remain viable over the long term –although at what price no one knows.It is interesting to note that the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is gainingtraction.
The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the world’s largest opensource blockchain initiative, is an industry-supported consortium that aims tobring Ethereum to an enterprise-grade level by supporting, promoting, andbuilding Ethereum-based technologies.
The Alliance has recently announcedthe addition of 48 new members, including Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank,and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).86Governments are going to be embracing the power of the blockchain.Microsoft Opens Blockchain Door to the government.
Companies likeMicrosoft are working with government organisations: “Blockchain makes itmuch harder for fraud and waste to exist, makes it much more visible if it doesexist and potentially gets rid of a lot of layers of bureaucracy that are designedsimply to ensure that waste and fraud [don't] exist." MicrosoftAre we going to witness a new norm of currency through cryptocurrency oneday? Researchers concluded that it is still too early to predict that it would, butone thing is for sure that this currency is slowly making its way in the world.The most targeted group of all would be the technologically savvy individualsand most of us are already part of this group.
Less than 50% of our time isspent online and this % is growing.One day, we might even consider using cryptocurrency as our standardcurrency for a more universal transaction.8717.
CryptocurrencyFrequently AskedQuestions (FAQs)The New Liquid Gold?Why is Bitcoin called ‘Liquid Gold’?Money in itself does not have any intrinsic value – it is only because we believethat it has value that it is worth anything.
Money is just a tracking system – wetrack what we own and what we owe.
This is called a ledger.
Whatever form ofmoney exists, we give it value because of its utility as a ledger (or trackingsystem of who owes what).Gold has been the Standard for over 5,000 years.
Then came coins in differentmetals and finally paper money.
All paper money was backed up by real Gold,so real Gold equivalent to the amount of money on the paper had to be storedin the bank.
That means if someone were to go the bank and ask to exchangetheir money for Gold, in theory they would have received it.
All this haschanged.
After Nixon abandoned the ‘Gold Standard’ in 1971, the US Dollarwas cut loose from Gold.
Other countries followed suit.Governments were now free to print as much of it as they wanted, as it didn’tneed to be backed up by Gold.
Banks started lending out 5-10 times theamount of money that savers put into their bank accounts.
All this causedmore and more money to be placed in circulation.
This is called ‘fiat’ money.Unfortunately the more fiat money is being printed ie to fund a war, pay backdebt or pump into the economy to stave off a recession, the less value it has.Meaning that the money in your pocket is worth less and less every single year.88So really it would make more sense to use something that holds its value, likeGold for example, and not fiat currency.
Gold only has value because it isscarce – it is becoming increasingly difficult to mine and supply is running out.Until Bitcoin and the blockchain, Gold had made for the best form of a ledgerdevised.
The problem is that Gold cannot easily be used for daily buying andselling because it is difficult to store, divide up and send.This is where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies come in, because they areeasy to store, divide up and send.The 5 characteristics of money1.Scarcity2.Divisible3.Transportable4.Durable5.Recognisable5 characteristicsof moneyFiat money Gold Bitcoin andcryptocurrenciesScarcity NO.More and morecan get printedevery day andthe value isfalling.YES.

However,unlike Gold, it is ALSO a day-to-day transactable currency as well, as it is easilydivisible to any desired amount.
You can buy biscuits, pay for your utility billsor buy a Tesla car (which you have been able to do using Bitcoin since 2013).All that needs to happen now is that Bitcoin needs to gain awareness so thatpeople can use it to buy and sell on a daily basis.
This is going to take time.Remember when credit cards first came out – it took time for people to usethem.
Or using the automatic scanning systems at WH Smith or Tesco’s?People don’t like change, unless they can see the benefits clearly and it ischeaper.
Bitcoin fits the bill.What is Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold?In August 2017 a group of miners split off from Bitcoin to create Bitcoin Cash,in the way Ethereum Classic was created by a group splitting off fromEthereum in July 2015.In October 2017 a group of miners did the same to create Bitcoin Gold.This is what is called a Hard Fork.
A group of miners ‘forked’ from the mainBitcoin blockchain by switching to a new version of software with greatertransaction capacity.This fork did not affect Bitcoin balances, but millions of Bitcoin users were alsogiven Bitcoin Cash Tokens and in October Bitcoin Gold Tokens as well.Is there a difference between a Coin and a Token and if so, what is it?The term “ICO” is now used for any new Coin or Token that comes on themarket.
However, this is not correct.
Coins and Tokens are two very differentthings.
A Coin (or Altcoin) is a variation of Bitcoin's open source code.
(Litecoinor Dogecoin are examples of this).
A Token on the other hand is a secondaryasset for Decentralised Application (DApps) within a blockchain ecosystem –91usually Ethereum.
Each DApp uses tokens to run.
(Golem is a DecentralisedApplication within the Ethereum blockchain system.
Its secondary asset is aToken called GNT.
The Gnosis Token is GNO, etc.).Confused? Maybe this will help.
Bitcoin is a decentralised – not centralised –distributed ledger that performs best as digital money.
Bitcoin’s consensusprocess is revolutionary but you can’t build much with it.
Ethereum, on theother hand, can do what Bitcoin does … and more.
It can be digital money too,but unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is highly programmable — it’s designed toaccommodate the construction of complex applications.
This is where theTokens come in.
A token can do many things while a coin can only do onething.
Coins really only have one utility — to act as simple stores of value withno other functionality.
Tokens are a completely different breed all together.They can store complex, multi-faceted levels of value.
Ethereum tokens aregenerated by a Smart Contract System (SCS), are highly programmable andhave multi-functionality because of it.
Through their functionality they becomemuch more than just a coin – they become “Tokens”...Bitcoin produces “coins.” Ethereum generates “tokens.” An “ICO” is aBitcoin/Altcoin thing.
A “Token Launch” is an Ethereum thing.
People aremixing up the two and until there is more regulation, it will continue to bemixed up.92Appendix:Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash SystemSatoshi Nakamotosatoshin@gmx.comwww.bitcoin.orgAbstract.
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sentdirectly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
Digital signaturesprovide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required toprevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peernetwork.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-basedproof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
Thelongest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came fromthe largest pool of CPU power.
As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that arenot cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.
Thenetwork itself requires minimal structure.
Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes canleave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of whathappened while they were gone.1.
IntroductionCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving astrusted third parties to process electronic payments.
While the system works well enough for mosttransactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely nonreversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediatingdisputes.
The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transactionsize and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the lossof ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services.
With the possibility ofreversal, the need for trust spreads.
Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them formore information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted asunavoidable.
These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physicalcurrency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without atrusted party.What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trustedthird party.
Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers fromfraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.
In this paper,we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestampserver to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.
The system issecure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group ofattacker nodes.2.
TransactionsWe define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.
Each owner transfers the coin to the nextby digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and addingthese to the end of the coin.
A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.93The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin.A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transactionfor double spending.
After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin,and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
The problem with thissolution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, withevery transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions.For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attemptsto double-spend.
The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of alltransactions.
In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided whicharrived first.
To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced [1],and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they werereceived.
The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed itwas the first received.3.
Timestamp ServerThe solution we propose begins with a timestamp server.
A timestamp server works by taking a hashof a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper orUsenet post [2-5].
The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, inorder to get into the hash.
Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming achain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.4.
Proof-of-Work94To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof ofwork system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
The proofof-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins withnumber of zero bits.
The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required andcan be verified by executing a single hash.For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the blockuntil a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.
Once the CPU effort has beenexpended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work.As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocksafter it.The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able toallocate many IPs.
Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.
The majority decision isrepresented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.
If amajority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest andoutpace any competing chains.
To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-ofwork of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honestnodes.
We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishesexponentially as subsequent blocks are added.To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number ofblocks per hour.
If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.5.
NetworkThe steps to run the network are as follows:1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in thechain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it.If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receiveone or the other first.
In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branchin case it becomes longer.
The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and onebranch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to thelonger one.95New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.
As long as they reach manynodes, they will get into a block before long.
Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages.If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes itmissed one.6.
IncentiveBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned bythe creator of the block.
This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a wayto initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
Thesteady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resourcesto add gold to circulation.
In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.
If the output value of a transaction is less thanits input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the blockcontaining the transaction.
Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, theincentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.
If a greedy attacker is able to assemble moreCPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people bystealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.
He ought to find it more profitable toplay by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, thanto undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.7.
Reclaiming Disk SpaceOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it canbe discarded to save disk space.
To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions arehashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can thenbe compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.
The interior hashes do not need to be stored.A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.
If we suppose blocks are generatedevery 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.
With computer systems typically sellingwith 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storageshould not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.8.
Simplified Payment Verification96It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.
A user only needs to keep acopy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying networknodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking thetransaction to the block it's timestamped in.
He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linkingit to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after itfurther confirm the network has accepted it.As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is morevulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.
While network nodes can verify transactionsfor themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as longas the attacker can continue to overpower the network.
One strategy to protect against this would be toaccept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software todownload the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency.
Businesses that receivefrequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security andquicker verification.9.
Combining and Splitting ValueAlthough it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separatetransaction for every cent in a transfer.
To allow value to be split and combined, transactions containmultiple inputs and outputs.
Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previoustransaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for thepayment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.97It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and thosetransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.
There is never the need to extract acomplete standalone copy of a transaction's history.10.PrivacyThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to theparties involved and the trusted third party.
The necessity to announce all transactions publiclyprecludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information inanother place: by keeping public keys anonymous.
The public can see that someone is sending anamount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.
This is similar tothe level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the"tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from beinglinked to a common owner.
Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, whichnecessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.
The risk is that if the owner of akey is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.11.CalculationsWe consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honestchain.
Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such ascreating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.
Nodes are not goingto accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containingthem.
An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recentlyspent.The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial RandomWalk.
The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1,and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruinproblem.
Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinitenumber of trials to try to reach breakeven.
We can calculate the probability he ever reachesbreakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:p = probability an honest node finds the next blockq = probability the attacker finds the next blockqz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind98Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks theattacker has to catch up with increases.
With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lungeforward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind.We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficientlycertain the sender can't change the transaction.
We assume the sender is an attacker who wants tomake the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after sometime has passed.
The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be toolate.The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing.This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on itcontinuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at thatmoment.
Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chaincontaining an alternate version of his transaction.The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked afterit.
He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but assuming the honestblocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poissondistribution with expected value:To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for eachamount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:Rearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution...Converting to C code...#include <math.h>double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z){double p = 1.0 - q;double lambda = z * (q / p);double sum = 1.0;int i, k;99for (k = 0; k <= z; k++){double poisson = exp(-lambda);for (i = 1; i <= k; i++)poisson *= lambda / i;sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));}return sum;}Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.q=0.1z=0 P=1.0000000z=1 P=0.2045873z=2 P=0.0509779z=3 P=0.0131722z=4 P=0.0034552z=5 P=0.0009137z=6 P=0.0002428z=7 P=0.0000647z=8 P=0.0000173z=9 P=0.0000046z=10 P=0.0000012q=0.3z=0 P=1.0000000z=5 P=0.1773523z=10 P=0.0416605z=15 P=0.0101008z=20 P=0.0024804z=25 P=0.0006132z=30 P=0.0001522z=35 P=0.0000379z=40 P=0.0000095z=45 P=0.0000024z=50 P=0.0000006Solving for P less than 0.1%...P < 0.001q=0.10 z=5q=0.15 z=8q=0.20 z=11q=0.25 z= 15q=0.30 z=24q=0.35 z=41q=0.40 z= 89q=0.45 z=34012.ConclusionWe have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.
We started with theusual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership,but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending.
To solve this, we proposed a peer-topeer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomescomputationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPUpower.
The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.
Nodes work all at once with littlecoordination.
They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular placeand only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.
Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will,accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
They vote withtheir CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and100rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.
Any needed rules and incentives can beenforced with this consensus mechanism.References[1] W.

But over the last 10,000 years, thematerial form that money has taken has changed considerably—from cattle and cowrie shellsto today's electronic currency.
Here, get an overview of the history of money.101Today we value gold Kruggerands and paper Franklins, but cattle and cowrie shells have also served ascurrency.

Some would evenargue that it's not purely a human activity; plants and animals have been bartering—in symbioticrelationships—for millions of years.
In any case, barter among humans certainly pre-dates the use ofmoney.
Today individuals, organizations, and governments still use, and often prefer, barter as a formof exchange of goods and services.9000 - 6000 B.C.: CATTLECattle, which throughout history and across the globe have included not only cows but also sheep,camels, and other livestock, are the first and oldest form of money.
With the advent of agriculture alsocame the use of grain and other vegetable or plant products as a standard form of barter in manycultures.1200 B.C.: COWRIE SHELLS102The first use of cowries, the shells of a mollusc that was widely available in the shallow waters of thePacific and Indian Oceans, was in China.
Historically, many societies have used cowries as money,and even as recently as the middle of this century, cowries have been used in some parts of Africa.The cowrie is the most widely and longest used currency in history.1000 B.C.: FIRST METAL MONEY AND COINSBronze and Copper cowrie imitations were manufactured by China at the end of the Stone Age andcould be considered some of the earliest forms of metal coins.
Metal tool money, such as knife andspade monies, was also first used in China.
These early metal monies developed into primitiveversions of round coins.
Chinese coins were made out of base metals, often containing holes so theycould be put together like a chain.500 B.C.: MODERN COINAGEOutside of China, the first coins developed out of lumps of silver.
They soon took the familar roundform of today, and were stamped with various gods and emperors to mark their authenticity.
Theseearly coins first appeared in Lydia, which is part of present-day Turkey, but the techniques werequickly copied and further refined by the Greek, Persian, Macedonian, and later the Roman empires.Unlike Chinese coins which depended on base metals, these new coins were made from preciousmetals such as silver, bronze, and gold, which had more inherent value.118 B.C.: LEATHER MONEYLeather money was used in China in the form of one-foot-square pieces of white deerskin with colorfulborders.
This could be considered the first documented type of banknote.A.D.
800 - 900: THE NOSEThe phrase "To pay through the nose" comes from Danes in Ireland, who slit the noses of those whowere remiss in paying the Danish poll tax.806: PAPER CURRENCYThe first known paper banknotes appeared in China.
In all, China experienced over 500 years of earlypaper money, spanning from the ninth through the fifteenth century.
Over this period, paper notesgrew in production to the point that their value rapidly depreciated and inflation soared.
Thenbeginning in 1455, the use of paper money in China disappeared for several hundred years.
This wasstill many years before paper currency would reappear in Europe, and three centuries before it wasconsidered common.1500: POTLACH"Potlach" comes from a Chinook Indian custom that existed in many North American Indian cultures.
Itis a ceremony where not only were gifts exchanged, but dances, feasts, and other public rituals wereperformed.
In some instances potlach was a form of initiation into secret tribal societies.
Because theexchange of gifts was so important in establishing a leader's social rank, potlach often spiralled out ofcontrol as the gifts became progressively more lavish and tribes put on larger and grander feasts andcelebrations in an attempt to out-do each other.1031535: WAMPUMThe earliest known use of wampum, which are strings of beads made from clam shells, was by NorthAmerican Indians in 1535.
Most likely, this monetary medium existed well before this date.
The Indianword "wampum" means white, which was the color of the beads.1816: THE GOLD STANDARDGold was officially made the standard of value in England in 1816.
At this time, guidelines were madeto allow for a non-inflationary production of standard banknotes which represented a certain amountof gold.
Banknotes had been used in England and Europe for several hundred years before this time,but their worth had never been tied directly to gold.
In the United States, the Gold Standard Act wasofficially enacted in 1900, which helped lead to the establishment of a central bank.1930: END OF THE GOLD STANDARDThe massive Depression of the 1930s, felt worldwide, marked the beginning of the end of the goldstandard.
In the United States, the gold standard was revised and the price of gold was devalued.This was the first step in ending the relationship altogether.
The British and international goldstandards soon ended as well, and the complexities of international monetary regulation began.THE PRESENT:Today, currency continues to change and develop, as evidenced by the new $100 U.S.
